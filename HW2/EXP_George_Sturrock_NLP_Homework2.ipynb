    "2.\tAfter consulting section 3.2 in chapter 1 of Bird-Klein, create a method for scoring the long-word vocabulary size of a text, and likewise normalize (and explain) the scoring as in step 1 above.\n",
    "3.\tNow create a “text difficulty score” by combining the lexical diversity score from homework 1, and your normalized score of vocabulary size and long-word vocabulary size, in equal weighting. Explain what you see when this score is applied to same graded texts used in homework 1.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the \"Beacon Second Reader\" the author has chosen for his stories only\r\n",
      "those of recognized literary merit; and while it has been necessary to\r\n",
      "rearrange and sometimes rewrite them for the purpose of simplification,\r\n",
      "yet he has endeavored to retain the spirit which has served to endear\r\n",
      "these ancient tales to the children of all ages. The fairy story appeals\r\n",
      "particularly to children who are in the second school year. It has been\r\n",
      "proved by our ablest psychologists that at about this period of\r\n",
      "development, children are especially susceptible to the stimulus of the\r\n",
      "old folklore. They are in fact passing through the stage which\r\n",
      "corresponds to the dawn of the human race, when demons, dragons,\r\n",
      "fairies, and hobgoblins were as firmly believed in as rivers and\r\n",
      "mountains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a test of this theory the author asked hundreds of second-grade and\r\n",
      "third-grade school children to recall the stories which they had read\r\n",
      "during the preceding year, and to express their preferences. The choice\r\n",
      "of more than ninety per cent proved to be either folklore stories, pure\r\n",
      "and simple, or such tales as contained the folklore element. To be sure,\r\n",
      "children like other stories, but they respond at once with sparkling\r\n",
      "eyes and animated voices when the fairy tale is suggested. How unwise,\r\n",
      "therefore, it is to neglect this powerful stimulus which lies ready at\r\n",
      "our hands! Even a pupil who is naturally slow will wade painfully and\r\n",
      "laboriously through a fairy story, while he would throw down in disgust\r\n",
      "an account of the sprouting of the bean or the mining of coal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It can hardly be questioned, moreover, that the real culture which the\r\n",
      "child derives from these literary classics is far greater than that\r\n",
      "which he would gain from the \"information\" stories so common in the\r\n",
      "average second and third readers.\r\n",
