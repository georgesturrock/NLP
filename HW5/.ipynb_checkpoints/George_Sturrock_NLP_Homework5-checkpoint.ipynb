    "##### Homework 5 Objectives\n",
    "1.\tCompile a list of static links (permalinks) to individual user movie reviews from one particular website. This will be your working dataset for this assignment, as well as for assignments 7 and 8, which together will make up your semester project.   \n",
    "a.\tIt does not matter if you use a crawler or if you manually collect the links, but you will need at least 100 movie review links. Note that, as of this writing, the robots.txt file of IMDB.com allows the crawling of user reviews.\n",
    "b.\tEach link should be to a web page that has only one user review of only one movie, e.g., the user review permalinks on the IMDB site.\n",
    "c.\tChoose reviews of movies that are all in the same genre, e.g., sci-fi, mystery, romance, superhero, etc.  \n",
    "d.\tMake sure your collection includes reviews of several movies in your chosen genre and that it includes a mix of negative and positive reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tExtract noun phrase (NP) chunks from your reviews using the following procedure:\n",
    "a.\tIn Python, use BeautifulSoup to grab the main review text from each link.  \n",
    "b.\tNext run each review text through a tokenizer, and then try to NP-chunk it with a shallow parser. \n",
    "c.\tYou probably will have too many unknown words, owing to proper names of characters, actors, and so on that are not in your working dictionary. Make sure the main names that are relevant to the movies in your collection of reviews are added to the working lexicon, and then run the NP chunker again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tOutput all the chunks in a single list for each review, and submit that output for this assignment. Also submit a brief written summary of what you did (describe your selection of genre, your source of reviews, how many you collected, and by what means).\n",

    "For this assignment, the first three films in the \"Rocky\" series will be utilized to collect reviews for noun phrase chunking.  Link to the main user review page for each of the three movies are shown below.  To assure both positive and negative reviews are collected, there are two links per movie.  One is sorted descending by user rating.  The other is sorted ascending by user rating.  Both links have \"spoiler alert\" messages suppressed as these reviews are often more akin to a summarization of the movie plot instead of a true review.  "

    "Question 5.3 requires a list of noun phrase chunks from each sentence in the movie reviews collected above.  Though the request is for a single list of noun phrase chunks, the results from both Spacy and Pattern chunking are shown below.  First, the Spacy chunks are generated.  The results of the Spacy chunker are impressive.  Visual examination of the results shown proper nouns are mostly handled accurately, and the noun phrases are accurately identified.  Futhermore, the process takes under three minutes are a modestly powered machine.  The chunk labels, which should be restricted to \"NP\" (noun phrase), noun phrase texts and the chunk roots are displayed for each chunk."

    "The Pattern modules parsetree also provides a method for sentence chunking as well.  The Pattern chunking also identifies noun phrases while also showing part of speech tags.  Additionally, certain proper names such as \"Sylvester Stallone\" are recongnized as the name of a person.  Even with a 0.75 second sleep for each journey through the for loop (too control the rate of messages sent through the jupyter server), the pattern chunker only takes approximately 2.5 minutes to complete its work on the same server as the Spacy chunker."
