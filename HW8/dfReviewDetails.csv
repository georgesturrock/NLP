1,Rocky,http:/review/rw0149538/?ref_=tt_urv,1999-11-25,"Dumbest, Most Cornball Film Ever Made","I still remember my initial outrage that this piece of sentimental slop was even made. As unrealistic as they get, this movie included so many cliches, stupidities, and bad acting that it proves for all time just how ignorant Hollywood and the movie-going public really are.",1,English,1
2,Rocky,http:/review/rw0149534/?ref_=tt_urv,1998-08-19,overrated piece of cheese,"grubby late-night fare achieved way too much success with a primitive story out of 1912.  A silly promotional song, laughable script and performances.  I have no clue why this picture, wearing its heart on its sleeve, ever achieved the critcal appreciation that it did.  This high -concept film is decently enough made, but it helped herald the wave of no -brain feel-good fare of the eighties to the present.  It is also incredibly racist, and seems to suggest that a boxing champ ""should"" be white, even though Apollo Creed does win the bout, the audience is supposed to be aghast.  More ghastly is this idiot in the ring who has his eyelid cut with a razor blade so he can keep on fighting.  I never bothered with the sequels, but Aki Kaurismaki's _Rocky VI_ ought to be even more laugh -provoking than this film.",2,English,3
3,Rocky,http:/review/rw1979442/?ref_=tt_urv,2008-11-22,The most overrated movie of all time,"I went to see this movie when it came out. I had never heard of Sylvester Stallone and had no expectations or preconceptions other than it was supposed to be a good depiction of boxing. I hated it when I walked out of the theater in 1976, and I hate it even more now. The film is one of sappiest pieces of melodramatic tripe I've ever seen. Every character is a stereotype, and every turn of its derivative, amateurish plot can be anticipated from 50 miles away. Now for the boxing -- a Popeye cartoon has more realistic action. It rivaled the most ludicrous exhibitions staged in professional wrestling matches, and any combatant who endured two minutes of the kind of pummeling depicted in the title fight would be brain dead. My contempt for this trash reached even greater depths when I watched it beat out three outstanding movies -- Network, Taxi Driver, and All the President's Men -- for the best picture Oscar (I've never seen Bound for Glory, but I have no doubt it was also a far better movie than this drivel). I can somewhat understand that a portion of the public would enjoy Rocky, but I can find no excuse for the voting of the Academy members. Shame on them for elevating this sorry excuse for a movie above such worthy contenders. It makes about as much sense as a punch-drunk bar-fighting buffoon landing a title fight with Muhammad Ali.",3,English,3
4,Rocky,http:/review/rw2406266/?ref_=tt_urv,2011-03-30,I can't believe the script was made into a movie...,"I was told by many that Rocky is a beautiful movie and I must watched. I did. The movie is set in the same annoyingly slow pace made unbearable by the clichéd characters that too are delineated horridly.

Although Stalone was not bad, the plot was. I don't even think its called a plot when you can guess the end with your eyes closed. If you enjoy watching grass grow this movie might seem a little fast paced and if you have never heard a story before or lack intellect you might find the plot gripping. 

I hated it and I want my time back. It was just overrated and I would not suggest this mind numbing movie to anyone, unless I hated them. Maybe thats why my friends told me to watch it, as a practical joke.",3,English,1
5,Rocky,http:/review/rw3647093/?ref_=tt_urv,2017-02-24,Eh....it was alright.,"I didn't particularly like this movie. Dimwitted athletes don't especially interest me. I realize many liked it, but there is no accounting for the public's taste. I generally enjoy most sports movies, too. I realize that this wasn't a pure sports movie, but I just couldn't get into it. The music irritated me, too. I can't believe they are still playing that annoying music.",3,English,3
6,Rocky,http:/review/rw3451942/?ref_=tt_urv,2016-04-15,Hate me if you want but I didn't like this film,"I'm going to come out and say it. I didn't like this film. I know that this is going to get me hate, but it's the truth. I don't have any interest in boxing, so the film's content or Rocky's struggle didn't really resonate with me, as well as it could have done. I didn't particularly like Stallone's portrayal of Rocky either. Between his mumbling and his shouting, I couldn't understand anything that he was saying. This didn't really help with me empathising with the character. Although all credit to the set-designers. Rocky's apartment did look like a horrible place to live with the peeling wallpaper.

Just thank God, Burgess Meredith was in it.

Along the way, he gathers confidence and meets a young woman who gives him the strength that he needs. This is a story of endurance and love, and it is one of the most quoted films of all time with the line 'Yo, Adrian! I did it!' There's also the famous clips of Rocky running, getting exercise to build up his endurance. This is filmed with the Rocky theme, 'Gonna Fly Now'. The story drags on a little bit, but those moments are worth fighting for. Not a bad film, and it does have a good choice of music and gives you a sense of hope.",4,English,3

9,Rocky,http:/review/rw3218345/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-04-11,Vastly overrated,"Vastly overrated.

Not sure how this got to be regarded so highly, and won the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. Story isn't too plausible and is quite dull in spells. 

The opening setup was interesting, as it painted a picture of a man in a dead-end situation. But then, just when you think the movie is going to be how he gradually works himself out of that situation, it turns out that it is all about winning a lottery, rather than hard work, essentially.

The only thing that made it watchable after that was the fight scene, right at the end. The Rocky-Adrian relationship is implausible, contrived and clumsy.

To add insult to injury, Sylvester Stallone got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his series of monosyllabic grunts that pass for dialogue. In total Rocky received three Academy awards plus seven other nominations. Of these, only the nomination for Best Original Song was deserved. 

One of the most over-rated and over-awarded films in history.",4,English,1
10,Rocky,http:/review/rw0149606/?ref_=tt_urv,2001-09-25,Good to watch,"This movie is worth a viewing every now and again but I must say it is quite boring in parts.  Who cares about your love life.

11,Rocky,http:/review/rw3794060/?ref_=tt_urv,2017-08-31,A screaming movie with some boxing undertones,"It's been a long time since I last watched it. I could've sworn it was a movie about boxing. About an underdog who gets a chance and makes the most of it.

But as I watch it now, I've come to realize it's in fact a movie about the dangers of brain damage. Every single person in this movie is brain damaged, from the boxers and trainers down to the ice rink janitor, meat hauling half-wit...

There are a couple of different ways how this shows. The most obvious and most irritating one is the way people communicate. Talking to people is done almost entirely via screaming. Everything turns into a screaming match. It is not only tiresome, but also just plain obnoxious.

Many parts of the movie are good, though. The premise is interesting, the setting dramatic just by itself. The boxing parts seem authentic enough, but there's not enough of it here to satisfy those of us who are only here for it.

All other things aside, first hour of the movie is skippable, and the rest pretty forgettable. If you took the screaming out, maybe it'd at least be tolerable, but as it is right now, it's not as good as you might remember. An iconic movie to be sure, but not a particularly good one.",4,English,1
12,Rocky,http:/review/rw2417298/?ref_=tt_urv,2011-04-21,Schlocky,"The most memorable moment in Rocky is the love-scene between and Adrian, both steaming the otherwise fetid room with such clean passion that it surpasses all cardinal passions. Adrian first tries to resists; an act shy but with slow excitement, then acquiesces and lastly is enticed. Rocky slowly allures kisses and then makes love. Both connect emotionally, nullifying each other's weaknesses. The problem is that 'this' is the best scene in the movie, while the 'action' and the 'sport' which should succeed, sag. This kind of movies should be a little unpolished but not indecisive. Rocky made me feel like watching just a sweet romance rather than an action, an underdog story. It more seems like Boxing Practice 101. Rule 1: Gulp down six raw eggs Rule 2: Jog a mile or ten! 

I've simply adored Million Dollar Baby for its guts, but mainly its balance of action and drama. The second half is so emotionally straining, I couldn't bear it in the end and cried my eyes out. Rocky could've been such a film had it not stooped to maudlin and pretense. The movie feels and looks more like the 30s, with I don't know, the accent maybe. Or the caricature that the supporting cast is. The opening scene is a normal boxing match with the brawny Stallone facing another unknown face. A small-time boxer and a collector for a 'large-hearted' loan-shark named Gazzo; he lives an ordinary life, loving his pets, trying to woo a painfully shy girl and teaching an androgynous girl lessons to act more womanly. His preference can be known from the conversation as he explains to her how a foul-mouthed girl would be termed nothing but a ""w**re"" in future, and would rather want a lady to be his wife, which he notices in Adrian. This small-timer is suddenly placed on a pedestal when he is given an opportunity to face the flamboyant, insidious, conceited world-champion Apollo Creed, who does this all for a ""good show"".

Sylvester does have inkling about what he has to do, but I didn't see any vigor in his eyes. In short, his eyes were dead. In the scene where he vents out his frustration on his to-be trainer for not having faith in him before, he says the line but means them not much. Also, it is difficult to overlook the garbled voice that he speaks in. However, the script is a shade better, replete with humor and love. But it is heavy-handed, especially during the end. Sly is better a screenwriter here. The choreography of the boxing sequences is anything but memorable though, as it never gains steam. The climatic boxing scene seems rushed and irresolute. Sly could've sought professional help in these sequences than writing it himself.

Talia is spot-on as the highly introverted, taciturn girl-friend who breaks down hysterically in one of the scenes. I could emphasize with her since I myself am a very introverted but caring person who have bouts of hysterics. The most captivating quality is that Talia doesn't speak much but remained composed in a way that radiates untold emotions. Her character is unfairly treated in the end where she seems more like the heroine from Grease who runs to her love in the end.

Others in the movie frankly don't matter much. Burt Young as the crass, resentful but attention-seeking, insecure brother of Adrian, to be honest, was plain forgettable. Burgess as the surly coach with a story of failure in the past is generic to the extreme. His ""come on, Rocky"" chants really don't work because such character is more suited for a college movie with unruly youngsters (i.e. Grease). Carl Weathers' character Apollo reminds me of Lady Gaga, and he is more of a friendly villain here, which is a contrast from other sports movies, but I prefer the old-fashioned ones, a figure to hate.

The story at times gets to verbose or drab, as one always expects a broken tooth or dislocated shoulder in the middle. Two fights won't do for a classic sports film. The direction is schmaltzy at multiple places, though noble at a few. The background score, even though had some potential hits, didn't have an enlivening effect to make you go ""YaY!"" in the end. Considering the tight budget, these slights errs can be forgiven. But even films with shoe-string budget can deliver better. And next time, please let Talia do the talking and Sly more action. May watch and review the sequel when I am free, though I am not too keen on it. 5/10",5,English,0
13,Rocky,http:/review/rw2057807/?ref_=tt_urv,2009-04-26,The Loser,"I wanted to rewatch this for a variety of reasons, but what tipped the scale were two ""ring"" movies that disappointed: ""Redbelt"" and ""The Wrestler.""

The reason for Rocky was the camera in the ring business. I remembered it as the very first movie that did this in a way that put you in the fight, that ""folded"" you into the cinematic space. Scorcese, for all his many faults, really did an amazing job by essentially remaking Rocky with clarity instead of the dullness of the Rocky character. Along the way ""Raging Bull"" really did set a new standard not just for ""in the ring"" camera-work, but a new vocabulary of relating between any two characters. Those 360 spins around two folks engaged in something special between them are the lowest form of this.

Anyway, ""Redbelt"" and ""Wrestler"" were by two competent folks, and I wondered. So I went back to Rocky. I may watch the whole series. What we liked at the time, and still do is the folding of reality into the story. This is Stallone's story, even down to his romance with a Copolla. It is where we first ever in film see a steadicam, first on the steps and them in the ring. At the time it was mindblowing. Now it is ordinary and rough.

So what we are left with is the now sharper knowledge of how reality overlaps with the fiction. And the story of course.

For me, that overlapping is everything. Pay attention to the dialog, every word of which comes from Stallone. See how rich his own speeches are, especially compared to the well delivered but trite speeches of others?

This will be an adventure for me, marching through the Rocky and Rambo stuff. I expect to be left better off than Stallone is.

14,Rocky,http:/review/rw4490600/?ref_=tt_urv,2018-12-02,"Builds character rather than spectacle, but isn't quite as gripping as you'd expect.","For a low-budget, 'take a chance' type film, 'Rocky (1976)' is pretty accomplished and realistic stuff, with its focus always on building character and setting up an empathetic underdog rather than on overt spectacle (something some of the sequels would go on to struggle with). Some of it has aged quite a bit, though, to the point that the final bout isn't necessarily one of the piece's highlights, with many a miss passing for a hit. This isn't necessarily a big issue considering that the flick isn't really about that anyway, though the fact that some of the preceding film is a bit of a drag and that some of Stallone's dialogue is hard to decipher is more of a problem. It's not bad, by any stretch, but it isn't massively gripping and feels slightly more passive than it perhaps ought to. 5/10",5,English,3
15,Rocky,http:/review/rw4186733/?ref_=tt_urv,2018-06-01,My dad forced me to watch it,"As my father brought us to watch the movie we got disappointed. He had it way better remembered in his mind that it was. It can't hold on to the suspense from nowadays. Either way, the camera is well guided and shows nice pictures, also the background story how Sylvester Stallone made the studios to produce his film is stunning. In conclusion for 16 years old, it can only impress with the picture quality and the background story. The story hasn't aged so that you can be packed during the film.",5,English,1
16,Rocky,http:/review/rw0149617/?ref_=tt_urv,2002-01-10,I Don't Get It,"I saw ""Rocky"" last night for the first time mostly out of guilt for never having seen it before.  It's always tossed in with the other great films from the 1970s, the most eulogized decade in film history, so I thought I might be missing something.

I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.  What distinguished this from all the other countless underdog-rises-to-the-challenge films is beyond me.  It was a fine little movie (if not incredibly slo-o-o-o-w), but I honestly don't know what makes it a classic.",5,English,3
17,Rocky,http:/review/rw1584633/?ref_=tt_urv,2007-01-28,Popular melodrama in a landmark era for American cinema,"1976. A landmark year in cinema. And one of the most heavily contested Academy awards in history. No matter how you look at it, the 70s was the greatest time for American cinema. Scorsese, Coppola, Lumet. Some of the fiercest battles were won in the Academy awards. And it was an exciting time for moviegoers.

While Rocky may get a bad rap for beating out some of these American classics for the prize, the fact remains it still is a powerful, inspirational film about a man's dreams to be the best no matter what obstacles lie in is his way.

The question is does it still hold up after over 30 years? The character of Rocky is one of the most memorable film characters ever and has and established Stallone as a serious filmmaker. Many of the sequences have been engraved in film and popular culture namely the training sessions, meat boxing and the final battle and closing scenes. For fans, these scenes continue to cause great emotional instability no matter how hackneyed and clichéd they have become today. And this is one is one of ""the greatest underdog stories ever told.""

Stallone carries the film for it's duration - no other actor probably could have played Rocky. The character is well developed by Stallone who wrote the screenplay and was Oscar nominated for both his acting and writing. Stallone's mannerisms, raw, dopey acting style fit the character like a glove. The writing was poetic, heartfelt and honest but I did feel that there were some pacing issues and where the film lagged a bit. You could argue that Stallone merely played himself but he did a good job overall.

The other strength of the film was the directing for which it won an Oscar. It sets up the Rocky's neighbourhood well, the missed opportunities, the darkness and lost hope. The shades of a dream wanting to be borne into light. The pacing was unusually sombre, quiet and patient for a orthodox story which ultimately worked in favour for the director.

But I just didn't connect with this film. I thought the story was too simple and clichéd (in light of watching this 30 years after it's release and in hindsight of more recent boxing films) and there were some dead moments. I would have liked to see more about the fight and less about Rocky's soap operatic antics with his girlfriend and family. In the end I felt it too melodramatic for me add to that the (I can't help it) overdone music and story.

Plus it is impossible not to think about the other American films around this era that have been lasted longer and more potently as a comment on American life and the dream. All the President's Men, Taxi Driver, Network and Raging Bull. All these films have something to say have hopes, dreams, and ideals. While Rocky has captured the hearts of the viewers, it's contemporaries remain timeless and more perceptive in today's world.",5,English,4
18,Rocky,http:/review/rw4284178/?ref_=tt_urv,2018-08-14,STUPIDLY OVERRATED!!! But it's still fine I guess,"I don't really understand why this movie won 3 oscars. Obviously best picture and best director are kinda subjective, but best editing? Besides the final fight the editing ranges from unremarkable to kinda bad. The characters are a mixed bag. Rocky himself is in a weird state of perpetual drunkenness. He's not annoying but not really likeable..... just strange. Adrien has no real development and is kinda boring. And Paulie is an unlikeable ass hat. Rocky's trainer is fine but he's barely in the film. But I did like Apollo, though he was barely in it, the actor was quite charismatic. And there are at least 3 plot elements introduced in the beginning that don't really go anywhere. I'll say the movie has 2 really good scenes in the 3rd act. There's the scene where he finally climbs those stairs, (you know the scene), and the final fight was actually quite good, and so the film goes out on a high note. But the first 2 act are OK at best and horrifically boring at worst. So overall, I was quite disappointed, but I can't call it a terrible movie so it gets 60%",6,English,1
19,Rocky,http:/review/rw1761787/?ref_=tt_urv,2007-11-11,"Yes, he's an underdog. Unfortunately, the movie never comes out of the corner.","""Rocky"" is, by no means, an intolerable film, but neither is it the perfect masterpiece, as has been described. The good thing about it is that Sylvester Stallone obviously has some kind of dream, motivation, determination, just like his on-screen persona.

The bad thing is, John G. Avildsen might as well be directing ""Rocky Watches Grass Grow,"" as nothing truly great happens until at least the last third of the movie. Burt Young and Talia Shire seem to live for their shouting matches, which are not that impressive when compared, say, to ""Reds"" or ""The Godfather"". Carl Weathers helps boost things, but it isn't until ""Rocky II"" that his character gets a fair shake.

It's a shame that for a movie this acclaimed, more couldn't have happened. But for many people, it is still the ultimate inspirational picture, that delivers a clever message with at least a couple ounces of ingenuity.

In other words, ""Rocky"" is a movie backed by a dream, but the dream is never quite fulfilled.",6,English,3
20,Rocky,http:/review/rw2959222/?ref_=tt_urv,2014-02-11,Not that big of a deal,"I hate to be one of those this-film-is-overrated people, but that is really the case for this film. Seeing this film for the first time (2014) I expected a lot more from it. I've heard so much about how amazing this film is and I just don't see it. It is a good film, but not great.

This is a fairly generic underdog story. The film is kinda boring until the last third and the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian doesn't really work. The way Rocky goes after her seems more like harassment than love. She doesn't show any interest in him. She feels really uncomfortable in Rocky's apartment and tries to escape but Rocky blocks her in. There's no way that two minutes later they're kissing. A big disappointment was Mickey, I thought he was going to be some awesome trainer like Mr. Miyagi but he's hardly in this film, and kind of a jerk. I'd heard of that one famous line of his ""You're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder,"" but I didn't realize that's basically the extent of the training he gives. The most iconic part of the film is probably the training montage (in which Mickey just watches him do push-ups and pull- ups) which is the best part of the film. I felt the words ""Trying hard now"" was actually referring to the filmmakers trying harder compared to the rest of the movie. Although without that song you have to admit all Rocky's really doing is running around and punching things. The final fight is alright, but fairly underwhelming. It doesn't feel like many of the punches are connecting, heck they don't even punch each other for a couple minutes. Fighting scenes can be a lot more intense than this, just look at the fighting in Warrior as an example.

It's not a bad film though. I think it was even quite good for its time, but it hasn't aged well. Maybe the film looks better in context with the other sequels, but standing alone this film just doesn't go the distance.",6,English,1
21,Rocky,http:/review/rw3443463/?ref_=tt_urv,2016-04-01,A triumph of self-pitying losers,"I'm well aware of the story behind the creation of Rocky, especially the fact that Stallone had a very hard time to draw the studios' attention to the screenplay which was his vision of a chance to get out of the obscurity his career and himself were in at that time. So if we were to look at Rocky as a defining moment for the Stallone's star then yeah, it's a pretty important film. However, i don't think that a film's merits should be defined by whose career it helped boost. And, as a separate cinematographic product, Rocky is not just undeserving to be among the best films of all times, it's plain average.

The whole fiber of the film oozes hopelessness and despair. And maybe Philadelphia of the 70's was indeed a grim place to live in. But the main reason for setting up a story in such a depressing environment is to allude the life of Rocky Balboa and those surrounding him to some kind of a Cinderella story and make us root for the underdog. And it might have even worked if Rocky was even slightly intriguing and charismatic.

Instead, Stallone's script does its best to avert the audience from Rocky. The first half of the film is basically a showcase of what a bum (if not a true imbecile) Rocky is. Unable to talk like a human being, instead mumbling some deranged nonsense, Rocky is more like Frankenstein than Cinderella, roaming around the murky streets of the Philadelphia slums, devoid of any idea how to live his life today or what to do with it tomorrow. The only way to make him look less of a creep was to give him pet turtles and an affection for an equally socially and emotionally disabled woman working in a store nearby, which might be sentimental enough to work for some, but feels unbelievably forced and corny to me.

But for the Cinderella story to work, Rocky had to receive an invitation to a ball. A title boxing fight in his case. Which happens late enough to get bored by Balboa's constant downer's attitude (how's that for an example: ""You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.""). But, luckily, still early enough to give the film some room to capitalize on that change. Because when Rocky finally shuts it and starts doing something useful, he becomes watchable at last. Even inspiring for some.

The end of this fairy tale is as predictable as it's gracious for the protagonist. It's by no means realistic, but i guess Stallone just didn't have enough star fever to write a better ending for his character. Still, the fact that the film ends rather abruptly is probably a sign that the author had no idea what to do next other than to call a woman to the rescue. Unfortunately, the impression that the whole film leaves is exactly the same: unaware of its goals, hardly knowing what to do, simply trying to go the distance because... well, because there's no much choice otherwise. Apparently, the audience loved that blind weary spirit back in the day, but now it looks like the success of Rocky and the career of Stallone itself were nothing but freak luck.",6,English,3

23,Rocky,http:/review/rw2033879/?ref_=tt_urv,2009-03-07,Of the Rocky's probably the most realistic.,"This movie was a rather good drama starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character Rocky. It also is one of those movies that has a theme that sticks with a person because it is so memorable. The movie, too is memorable although kind of slow moving in places as well. They try a bit to hard making Rocky seem real, showing a bit to many details of his courtship of Adrien, though I have to say that these scenes while slow help with the ending making it a bit more emotional. The story, the heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is about to fight a title bout. Well the person he is supposed to fight drops out so Apollo decides to fight an unknown guy and picks a local named Rocky. Rocky is a bit of a washed up fighter, he can win but he does so clumsily. The trainer who I think owns the gym, Mickey, decides to help Rocky train for this fight and these two opposing forces meet in the ring for more of a fight than Apollo was expecting. This fight is a bit more realistic than the fight in two in that Apollo was not taking this fight seriously at all and was not training hard. An underdog that he had never really seen before could have taken him by surprise the way Rocky did here. So a good fight sequence a some filler before then to pull at the heart strings and inspire one. Still good though for a sports movie.",7,English,3
24,Rocky,http:/review/rw2424756/?ref_=tt_urv,2011-05-06,An Involving Movie In the Face of Its Otherwise Hackneyed Substance,"American cinema in the 1970s was marked by the new generation of filmmakers' bombshell of originality, liveliness, sexuality and a fervor for the artistic importance of film itself, with a pervading emphasis on realism, subversive political themes and sexual candor. But what won Best Picture in the year of Taxi Driver, Network and All the President's Men---the legendary arguable masterpieces of three of contemporary cinema's finest directors---is this paint-by-numbers inspirational sports flick. Stallone's screenplay is the most wholesome 1930s Hollywood fantasy. It's the tale of Rocky and his girl Adrian, when he, because of conditions too irrational to go into, is given the chance to fight the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, fashioned after Muhammad Ali so sketchily as to be a practically senseless misuse of character. It's not sufficient enough to even be defamation, but by making the Ali-like fighter such a garish fool, the film treads regions of undeveloped racism that might not be all that undeveloped.

There are intermittent twinklings that the film may be condescending to the subordinate end of the proletarian attitude, as much if not more than the characters who continue putting Rocky down, like Gazzo's bodyguard and the (black) boxer who taunts Rocky after usurping his locker. Then again, Avildsen is known for creating such indistinctness with films he made before such as Joe---which dealt with what mainstream film hadn't yet dared about the neutral depiction of overt racists, junkies and gritty urban living---and the great Save the Tiger, which punctured stereotypes and sought longingly and urgently for answers to the seeming moral predicaments of modern times. Rocky is a devolution of that thread.

However, there are some extremely fine actors in other supporting parts. Burt Young is convincing as Rocky's best friend, a drunk jerk, as is a both deservedly Oscar-nominated and very underused Burgess Meredith as Rocky's antiquated trainer. It's actually Shire who comes off the best, Coppola's sister and Connie in his Godfather saga. She's a genuine actress, truly moving and also droll as a budding bachelorette who comes behind schedule to sexual life. She's so effective, actually, that she almost adds credence to Stallone's performance, which is frankly way too goofy. (I keep getting the impulse to mock him out loud in that mongoloid exaggeration of Italian-American brute brogue.) So Rocky, by day, is a petty debt collector for a neighborhood loan shark played by Joe Spinell. Rocky's the kind of character who evinces his genuine compassion by thinking twice about breaking a stakeholder's thumb. At night, as we all by now very well know, chases a substandard boxing career in rundown sporting rings. But consider when Shire sits, crying and furrowed, in a corner of her small bedroom. Her brother has wrecked the living room with a baseball bat. Rocky, the guy she has become smitten by, enters. She timidly asks him if he wants a roommate. ""Absolutely,"" he says, which is precisely what he should say, and how he should say it, and why Rocky is such an involving movie despite its otherwise ultimately stale framework.",7,English,3
25,Rocky,http:/review/rw4573394/?ref_=tt_urv,2019-01-10,Mythical. Honest. American.,"This film uses boxing, and a bum's life to provide a engaging look into the American dream. What the dream is. Why it is unattainable for so many people. And what happens to those lucky few who do make it. Rocky only gets his shot because of the sheer luck of his nickname; America loves an underdog, but they also love a cynical entertainer. Stallone's script is really good at capturing this dual quality. So much of this film is just easy naturalism. The central love story is the most ordinary love story in the whole world. Paulie and Micky are just a couple of guys who missed their shot and resent Rocky for it.

And yet for all that easy naturalism the film has a grand quality to it. The fights are quite good, especially for the time. The film is filled with symbolism, some of it quite overtly religious. Creed riding in as Washington is a mythical image about American mythology. It is not surprising that this film spawned so many sequels. Americans love sagas too.",10,English,1

When it comes to performance I honestly do not know where Rocky starts and Sylvester Stallone ends. Stallone did not just play this character he conceived, created and crafted it. This is not method acting this goes way beyond that. 

What is this film about? Loneliness, love, self-respect, poverty, heartache, shyness, chance, pride, friendship, boxing? It is about life! 

Rocky is a downtrodden character, in the words of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) Rocky is a bum, a loser, he had talent but never applied it. Rocky does not see this, he lives his life, he has some boxing skills which he puts to use in the occasional low-key cash fights and working as a money collector for the local crime lord (Joe Spinell). Rocky has the physical attributes for the debt collecting job but deep down he has a soft heart. He is not the smartest guy but ultimately he is a good guy. 

Rocky is friends with Paulie (Burt Young) who is a deeply flawed character. Unlike Rocky he has a chip on his shoulder at life and the cards he has been dealt. Paulie has a sister Adrian (Talia Shire) that has not had an easy life either. She is painfully shy and introverted. Adrian works at the local pet shop which Rocky visits often. Rocky tries to make conversation and get to know her. The courtship between Adrian and Rocky is awkward at times but has a reality and sweetness that is undeniable. Rocky and Adrian eventually date. 

Rocky's life is on a nowhere trajectory until out the blue his name is selected by Apollo Creed (Carl weathers) the heavy weight champion of the world as a publicity stunt. Apollo Creed wants to stage a boxing event where a lowly ranked amateur boxer gets a chance to fight for the title, ""The American dream"". Initially stunned and unwilling to take on this challenge, Rocky does not feel he is worthy or capable of this. Mickey eventually persuades Rocky to take this once in a lifetime chance. And so begins the rest of the film. Cue training montage.

The all american tale of the loveable underdog who does extraordinary things.  Sly Stallones greatest role he has come up with and one of the greatest characters ever made.

30,Rocky,http:/review/rw2234516/?ref_=tt_urv,2010-04-11,An 8.0 is way too low for this film!,"Despite horrid sequels, ""Rocky"" is one of the most influential films of all time and should be, without a doubt, on the top 50 greatest films list. Putting it below 200 is just ridiculous. It has superb acting, a great story, and a phenomenal iconic following. Also, it can relate to anybody because everybody has been the underdog at one point. Maybe not the greatest sports movie of all time (I'd give that one to ""Raging Bull"") but it is the film that everybody references and spoofs. Featuring so many classic moments (eating the raw eggs, pounding the meat, etc.), its the typical underdog story that was made before it was typical. Every other story or film made nowadays involving somebody being the underdog is just a child of this film and how powerful and moving it is. In my opinion, the silly sequels (mainly 3, 4 and 5) have given this film a bad name and a bad reputation. Definitely a pure cinematic masterpiece, Rocky also won 3 Oscars, including Best Picture, which many of the films that are ahead of it on this list haven't even came close to. One reason why this film is great is because it came from Sly's heart (he had a struggling life and this film was his million to one shot, quite possibly one of the reasons why this is one of the few films he acts well in). The rest of the films in this series are made for money, which is the only thing they have going for them.",10,English,1

Rocky is a struggling boxer who is also a debt collector to make extra money. He lives in the slums of Philadelphia alone.

Most people do not realize that Rocky is a love story too. Rocky falls in love with a shy girl, Adrian, who is Paulie's(Rocky's friend) sister. This is another reason why Rocky is such a good movie, the love story is amazing.

Apollo Creed is the Heavy Weight Champion of the world, and the fighter who he is scheduled to fight, is hurt and is unable to fight. Apollo wants a fight, so he can get his money.

Rocky gets a call from Apollo's manager telling him to come down and talk. At first Rocky thinks that Apollo needs a sparing partner, but then see's that it is much bigger than that.

Rocky is offered to fight Apollo Creed for the belt because Apollo believe's that ""America is the land of opportunity"".Rocky first shocked and scared, but then accepts the challenge.

Mickey, his trainer, who had right before then telling Rocky that he had wasted his boxing career comes back and trains Rocky for the fight.

Along the way Rocky finds love, friendship, and the meaning of his life. Rocky is the American dream, being the underdog, and proving everybody wrong.

The movie's purpose is not showing a boxer's life in details. It's a sad and realistic movie. I don't know how many of you realized that many parts of the movie were like a documentary of the life of an average American and if we cut the whole sport thing, the movie would have been a documentary that make us think and realize how lucky we are. Rocky's life sucked and boxing for him was something more than just hobby or something he likes to do. It's the thing that destroyed the bad thoughts in his mind. He might have seemed stupid and careless about what is going to happen to him, but I don't think so. Haven't you ever met a person who doesn't show he cares about something with facials, actions or words, but he just feels it inside him and he doesn't feel the need to release it. That was Rocky's character and that is why I love that movie. Well one of the many reasons. The supporting characters are wonderful as well and the original Rocky is something not to be forgotten ever while the sequels are just entertaining. Once again - a wonderful motion picture I will always love, with great atmosphere, score. Well some bad editing and direction, but who cares. A movie with no flaws wouldn't be a movie.",10,English,1

35,Rocky,http:/review/rw2243336/?ref_=tt_urv,2010-05-01,The perfect movie that originally came out at the perfect time,"First, allow me to bat aside the cynics who now disparage this masterpiece of a movie by pointing out that - in the full context of the time in the U.S. when it was released - this was exactly the kind of movie we immediately were ready to fall in love with. Rewind back to 1976, post-Watergate, the Arab oil embargo, deep recession, the Soviet Union on the march, and the era that saw the invention of the terms ""malaise,"" ""misery index,"" and ""stagflation."" To make matters worse, all this economic and foreign policy decline was occurring on the bicentennial of our nation's founding. Along comes a movie about a lowly amateur boxer who earns just enough to pay for his hovel of a Philadelphia apartment as a ""collection agent"" for a loan-shark, using his menacing size as the ""penalty"" for debtors slow to pay back their loans and gigantic interest. Yes, it's the classic underdog story, and yet Stallone - who both wrote the script and played the starring role - and director John Aldiss somehow managed to craft a movie that allows the audience to fall into believing the story and cheering enthusiastically to the end. Incredibly, they managed to produce this movie for a grand total of one million dollars, a shoestring budget by even the standards of the time, and somehow that only added to the realism. This movie also saw - for the first time in a major film - the use of a brand new technological innovation: the Steadycam That particular innovation greatly enhanced the illusion that the audience is literally running alongside Stallone as he runs through the seedy neighborhoods of Philadelphia, getting in shape for the big fight with the Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed. It turns out that the set they used for Stallone's apartment was not really a set at all, but in fact a genuinely shabby hole. There is litter in the streets, too, and that only enhances the point that this is a real nobody trying to show that he can be a somebody. There is also a love interest in this movie, played perfectly by Talia Shire as Adrian. When Stallone first sees her, she is a dowdy young woman wearing hideous cat lady glasses, frumpy clothes, and (worst of all) a gray wool watch cap. She is also extremely shy and reluctant to respond to Rocky's affections. Somehow Rocky sees through through all that, and (later) also shows that Adrian is in fact a strikingly beautiful woman. As Rocky courts Adrian, Heavyweight Champ Apollo Creed (played brilliantly by Carl Weathers) is growing bored with the routine nature of selecting his next challenger. Creed takes the daring (and very smart) move of deciding to do something radical by offering an unknown the chance to fight him for a shot at the title. Creed knows that this will only draw more fans because of its unusual nature, plus he is cocky enough to believe that the challenger will be a cinch to defeat. Rocky at first does not want to do this, since he senses what is really going on, plus he also realizes that he is being used as a prop for a kind of publicity stunt. However, he also realizes what this would mean for him, and retired trainer Mickey (the role of a lifetime from the great Burgess Meredith) talks him into it, with himself as the trainer. Mickey himself had boxed quite a bit in his youth, never quite reaching the big time, and he sees in Rocky the opportunity for both of them to reach it. The story progresses from there, Rocky at first in agony as he struggles to run even a short distance, the Bill Conti soundtrack expertly conveying the lonely pain of an out of shape contender. Later, under Mickey's instruction and with confidence building, the soundtrack becomes upbeat with the now familiar ""Gonna Fly Now"" propelling it along. As all this happens, it really is hard to remember that this is only a movie, and the final ten minutes are some of the finest in movie history. I will not spoil this for those who have never seen it, except to say that the ending is absolutely perfect, and I am unembarrassed to admit that even now I get a bit misty when I see it. Again, getting back to the context of the time that this movie was released, I suspect that if this movie had come out in 1996 instead of 1976, it might not have gained the iconic status it now enjoys. Yes, it's true, the story of Rocky nicely mirrors that of America as a whole, and that makes it all the more appealing. And I don't care if I get derided as some kind of flag waver for having written that. If you have not had the chance to see this movie, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy and watch. Another point that should be mentioned is that this is neither a guy flick nor a chick flick, but instead a perfect blend. It's terrific to watch alone, as a couple, or a whole crowd. Trust me, you won't regret it!",10,English,7
36,Rocky,http:/review/rw4510051/?ref_=tt_urv,2018-12-13,A mirror image of life in general.,"A lot of us movie-goers are either working class heroes or middle-class warriors. Barely any of us will truly understand what it is like to be a superhero or a millionaire. Most of us just live in a rat race full of others just like us; Blue collared laborers trying to make it to tommorow.

Rocky is just like a lot of us - he's a 30 year old high school dropout who lives on simple things, but his perk is that he likes fighting as a hobby. However, despite the fact he is good at it, He never pursues it into a profession, much to the disdain of his trainer, Mickey. However, one day, the World Heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed realizes all the contenders for his title are either injured, out of shape, or scared of him. However, he has put so much energy into promoting a fight for the american bicentennial birthday, he becomes desperate for a challenger, and hoping for a safe bet, reads Rocky's moniker, the Italian Stallion and wants him to fight, insuring himself an easy victory. However, Rocky sees this as his chance to prove that he's ""Not just another bum from the neighborhood.""

Rocky has actually held up very well in the 40+ years since it's release. It's tough for a movie to age well but Rocky does just fine. The gritty, mean, dirty feel of downtown philadelphia still holds up today, as many of us have seen those types of gritty, broken down neighborhoods in our time.

As for the acting, Sylvester Stallone knew exactly what he wanted in the Rocky character and he was right to argue for the right to play the role. His co-stars Burt Young, who plays Paulie, Rocky's drunk, lazy, lethargic but loyal friend, is also very spot on in attitude and in looks. Talia Shire, who stars as Rocky's love interest Adrian, plays the fragile, shy virgin girl who over the next few movies, grows stronger, almost as if Rocky's positive attitude rubs off on her over time. Burgess Meredith plays Mickey, a bitter old trainer who feels that Rocky is a waste of time, but thinks he might change his attitude after being given a world title shot. And the World Champion Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, is an almost exact duplicate of the legendary fighter, Muhammad Ali. To put it bluntly, EVERYONE in this film knows exactly who they're trying to be, and they do it flawlessly.

Bill Conti's score will forever be timeless in this film. Everyone at some point has to have heard the Rocky theme song, which will forever stand out as a masterpiece. Every song and musical piece conveys emotions extremely well, from the somber & unsure ""Philadelphia morning"" to the powerful, emotional, and motivational ""Going the Distance.""

If you haven't seen this film before, you are truly missing out. There's a reason this movie is in the top 250 on the IMDb and odds are it's going to stay there for a very, very long time.",10,English,8

It is uplifing, well made, well directed, well acted, well scored and well, it is "" well "" everything.  This is the movie that started one of the greatest heroes and greatest careers in the history of Hollywood.  And it proves that in life and on the screen if you want something bad enough, you have to go out and take it, because no one is going to give it to you.  To tell you what this film is about and then give a small critique is rather pointless.  We all know about Rocky.  And my review is not going to do anything to enhance your like or dislike of the film.  By now, you either like the character or you don't.  You like Stallone or you don't.  So judge for yourself if this film is good or not.  I personally think it is great.  But for me this was much more than a film.  This is much more than a metaphor about life.  To me, this is a Bible for anyone who has a dream.

Stallone put his life on the line to get this movie made.  He believed in himself and he believed in what he had to say.  He was offered a huge amount of money to sell the film and let someone else play Rocky.  He held out and told them that he wanted the title role and even though at the time his wife was pregnant, they had very little money and he was hanging by a thread, he took that stand.  And the rest is history.  Could you imagine anyone else in that role now?  Does anyone really fit the mold that Stallone made for us? No.  And this film inspires me to be more than I am.  It inspires the dreamer in all of us to go for what we want and damn the consequences.  If I ever meet Stallone one day, I will personally thank him for making this film.  It changed my life forever and gave me hope to make my dream come true.  Rocky didn't stop until his dream came true and neither did Stallone. Why should I?  Why should anyone?",10,English,1

Author: Nic Feinholz"" this is a deuce-bag who's review is just from a perspective from a lousy film student. Rock was a 1976 motion picture starring and written by Sylvester Stallone who is a great actor, but does not always choose the best movies. The story is about a boxer named Rocky Balboa who is a man of heart but when he is in the ring, he is a ferocious gorilla. Rocky is given a one-shot opportunity for the world title by the champion himself Apollo Creed. Now with a chance of a life time, Rocky needs help from former boxer and trainer Mickey and the support of his girlfriend Adrian to rise up to the challenge and take the guts and glory. The film is a masterpiece as it has a very realistic feel to it, the acting is great, and the music is legendary as it makes the famous scene of Rocky running the steps seem even more epic, the movie is a definite must watch.",10,English,3
41,Rocky,http:/review/rw1551754/?ref_=tt_urv,2006-12-22,"In all honesty, one of the best movies of all time.","I'm not going to attempt to explain how much i love this film. I may honestly be the biggest Rocky fan there is. I don't have a room filled with posters and Rocky coffee mugs. I don't know Stallone's shoe size or any stuff like that. But that's not what a true fan is. A true fan is someone who appreciates the movie more than most do. Every time i watch this film i'm reminded of just how much it means to me. By far, it's my favorite movie.

What people have to say about Rocky have become clichéd statements. Not because they are, but because when dealing with a movie like this, that's really the only way you can sound. And to me, that makes it all the more impressive. When all you can say about a movie is who inspirational it is. Or how it truly grasps the human spirit, that shows how great of a film it is. 

Rocky is so much more than a fighting movie. It doesn't do justice to it to even call it that. It's a movie that so beautifully defines the human spirit, that it's overwhelming to watch. It does what so many B movies tried to do and it does it without being corny or over preachy. It's an unfathomable movie which really should be recognized as a statute in film history.

A lot of people poke fun at Stallone's acting carrier, but in this movie it's unlike anything i've ever seen. And i've seen a lot. Stallone was nominated for best actor and best screenplay and there's no doubt in my mind he was cheated out of a much deserved Oscar. His performance is so real and indescribably touching that it's hard to imagine there's a camera in front of him. The rest of the cast is also great. More than great. Burt Young, Tila Shire, and Burgess Merideth were all nominated for Oscars and in my opinion they all clearly deserved to win. Well, between Merideth and Young, i'd have to give it to Merideth, but it's very close. 

I'm fully aware of how cliché it sounds, but Rocky is a movie which captures the human spirit. It inspires you to keep moving ahead. Against all odds, in your darkest moments of despair you have to pull yourself together and keep going. We all have a chance in this life to do what we aspire to and no matter how large or small that chance may be, it exists. And it's worth fighting for. 

That's what Rocky embodies, and it does so beyond all expectations.",10,English,1

A man on his 29th birthday received $200 dollars if I can remember. He spent half on his birthday needs and wants, and he took the rest to see a fight between Wepner and Ali. That man was Sylvester Stallone. That night he went home and wrote the story of his own life, although some sites will tell you otherwise he really based it off his own life. He had taken his picture down to agencies and people turned him down. One time he even erupted throwing furniture around the room because he didn't get the fight. He had had previous movies but they were not successful. He said that if Rocky didn't make any money all hope was lost. Nobody wanted Sly to play Rocky. Stars were looked at such as James Caan and Ryan O'Neal. But Rocky said he would play the part or he wouldn't do it at all. What followed was a movie phenomenon. Sylvester never imagined it would go as well as it did. This movie is perfect if you want a good story. I has a story of gentle, sweet, and wonderful love between Rocky and the shy pet shop Adrian. It has the meaning of getting self-respect by competing for the title of the heavy weight champion of the world and lasting the 15 rounds, thereby going the distance. This is a great family film. Other than the hanky-panky between Rocky and Adrian and the bloody images of Rocky, this movie is great for the young ones. So what are you waiting for?

The relationship between Rocky and Adrian takes centre stage and despite the un-realistic story with respect of the boxing, this is more engaging, this is basically an against the odds movie, not designed for realism but to have elements of realism in it. The script is good and Sly hasn't written anything nearly as good since. What makes this film so successful however are the fantastic performances. Stallone is excellent as Rocky, its a fantastic performance right down to the way Rocky moves and the mannerisms, while Talia Shire is equally good as Adrian. The scenes between Sly and Talia are movie magic. Burgess Meredith is also excellent and there is a fantastic turn form Burt Young as Adrian's abusive brother Paulie. This isn't mindless escapism like the sequels, its pure drama. *****",10,English,1

47,Rocky,http:/review/rw0149565/?ref_=tt_urv,2000-08-15,The greatest movie ever made.,"The best movie of all time.  Period.  Everyone knows the basic plot of Rocky by now, but you must understand the way it is developed.  Stallone spends the first part of the script showing what a nobody Rocky really is.  Then he shows how Apollo Creed is looking for a joke; he doesn't want a boxing match, he wants someone with a funny name to beat up.  He is in for surprise...",10,English,1
48,Rocky,http:/review/rw1998671/?ref_=tt_urv,2008-12-30,More than just a sports or boxing movie. A human triumph of the human spirit an underdog goes the distance!,"1976's best picture winner ""Rocky"" in my opinion is one of the better films ever made it touches your emotions in so many ways it's just not a boxing movie, it's simply a tale of a human spirit triumph. It's also a significant film for the way it was made. Sly Stallone virtually unknown and broke got the inspiration for this when real life and underdog boxer Chuck Wepner had went the distance with the ""Greatest"" Muhammad Ali. Stallone wrote the script on a shoestring budget and it's a real knockout winner and sentimental favorite for many reasons.

Rocky Balboa(Stallone)a fourth rate and tomato can Philadelphia club fighter is a man who's lonely and at 30 even resorts to earning a living as a collector for street thugs on the mean streets of the city of brotherly love. Yet still buried deep down he has the desire and the hunger and heart to be a good fighter.

Along the way the film is also somewhat an emotional journey of a love story as Rocky finally finds some companionship and love when he meets a shy and ordinary and lonely pet store clerk named Adrianna(Talia Shire). Plus very memorable and comical is the supporting performance of Adrianna's brother the funny and very rugged looking and rude Paulie(good performance by Burt Young). The best of the supporting cast and maybe one of the best in film history is from legendary Burgess Meredith as Mick the tough and rough but very wise and humble old man. Who after some friction and doubt sees the determination and fire that the Italian Stallion has, so Mick decides to train Rock for a title match against the champ Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers).

For a film that's very cherished and memorable the performances are great, the acting, story and even the musical score is touching the sounds are some of the best in film history. The movie seen by many so many times is a true classic for it's tale of an underdog who went the distance an unknown who became known a hero to the working class. The film is truly an inspiration and it proves with work and determination and hunger the human spirit can achieve anything. It's not always whether you win or lose, but how you fight and it's important to go the distance. Overall a classic one of the best films in history for it's inspirational message proving that with the desire to fight your spirit will go the distance!",10,English,3
49,Rocky,http:/review/rw3348388/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-11-03,A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !,"Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. and BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!! 

It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his ""fight"" in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.

Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody"". The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity — just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many. This film is truly a classic and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.

Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and both written by and starring Sylvester Stallone.

52,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw1845203/?ref_=tt_urv,2008-03-23,Rocky Two The legend continues,Rocky two picks up almost at the same second the last one leaves off. Rocky has been hurt badly and retires from boxing and marries Adrian and settles down. He quickly spends his fight money buying things that they want a house a car and other expenses. Apollo Creed on the other hand is humiliated beyond belief his fight with Rocky is met with scorn from his fans and Apollo wants Rocky back in the ring for a rematch for the Title. Rocky soon is broke and trying to find a real job and Adrian gets pregnant. Apollo begins a harsh campaign to draw Rocky back into the ring and suddenly everything falls apart for Rocky. Rocky accepts to fight Apollo and Adrian gives birth prematurely and lapses into a coma. Rocky questions himself and wonders if fighting Apollo is what he really should be doing. Adrian recovers and tells him to win and Rocky trains and meets Apollo for one last chance at heavyweight Glory. Now the Story is not original but Stallone breathes fresh life into it and makes it seem fresh. This is the Story most Rocky fans remember fondly and this is the story most Rocky fans Wanted. A worthy sequel to Rocky well worth seeing as it never lets you down and it brings you up cheering at the end.,10,English,1
53,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0170468/?ref_=tt_urv,2003-03-26,One of the greatest sequels of all time!,"Rocky II was a true continuation story of Rocky the underdog.This time the obstacles he has to overcome include his sight depletion,lack of

mainsteam work qualifications-partially due to illiteracy,Adrian's complications during child birth{coma} & his promise to ADRIAN he would retire from the ring.Rocky's personality overcomes all because he is

a champion in life.He has tremendous personal qualities of family values,religion,loyalty,fidelity,coachability,ability to get along with others,kindness to animals & sense of humor.One of my favorite all-time lines is when GAZZO asks if he would like to invest some of the winnings from his first fight into 'condominiums' & Rocky replies 'I never use them'.Classic!Beyond Rocky himself,Burgess Meredith gives what I consider the greatest performance as a fight manager/trainer in the history of movies.Mickey {Meredith} was crusty,tough, & 'old school' as they come.Meredith delivered such powerful acting as the taskmaster trainer that you could feel his inner strength.He was a man who overcame life's hard knocks to get his shot WITH ROCKY as champion of the world.It was MICKEY'S years of learning & retaining while getting slammed that allowed him to put his life & soul into ROCKY BALBOA.He tells ROCKY in the chapel while they were praying for ADRIAN that if ROCKY wanted give up his title shot & fail that he MICKEY would be willing to fail right along with him.He stayed there in the chapel praying & in the hospital with Rocky until Adrian awoke.Last TALIA Shire was beautiful in this film.Adrian's shyness was gone because of her new confidence from her love & marriage to ROCKY.All this seemed to reflect in Adrian's{SHIRES} moody eyes.Her eyes really shined in her romantic scenes with ROCKY;her eyes showed anger at the commercial people,& and her eyes showed deep disappointment when Rocky & Mickey agreed to the rematch with CREED.Weathers once again was simply outstanding as APOLLO CREED.This time he was fighting for his broken pride which could not accept that Balboa had taken him 15 rounds as some unknown club fighter.But CREED learned that ROCKY was much more than that.He was a champion waiting to happen.Godfather II got all the awards, but ROCKY II has all the heart.To this day Rocky Balboa is an international hero.Just like this sequel!

56,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0952293/?ref_=tt_urv,2004-10-26,CLASSIC!!,"One of the best movies I have seen. Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) is provoked by Apollo Creed for a re-match as he wants to show the world that Rocky's heroics in the first movie were just a fluke. Rocky's wife doesn't want Rocky to continue fighting and slips into coma while delivering birth to their child. When she comes out of coma, things change and a new chapter in boxing is written. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa is amazing, be his interview comments before the re-match or the frustration that builds up in him when his wife is unhappy with the prospect of his entering the ring again. The fight is exciting, adrenalin pumping and highly action packed. The supporting cast is excellent, Rocky's wife, his brother-in-law and Mickey, Rocky's coach. The dialogues are classic, the story is engrossing and direction is good.

This is a must watch for all those who want to watch an action movie with a difference. It is a never forgetting experience.",10,English,1
57,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw4209210/?ref_=tt_urv,2018-06-20,Great sequel,This is a sequel that does everything a sequel should do. Develop the characters more feels grander and scale but still feels like the first movie. This is a great sequel and you should watch it.,10,English,3
58,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0170479/?ref_=tt_urv,2003-11-08,The Best of the lot,"Definitely one of the classics, Rocky 2 is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. Sylvester Stallone is at his best in the Rocky series, no one could have acted out the character of Rocky Balboa any better.

 If Rocky Balboa `shocked the world' in the first film, surely he couldn't do it again??? Not surprisingly, the way this film builds up to the big rematch between Balboa and Apollo Creed is incredible. The odds were stacked against Balboa in the last match against Creed, and this time those odds have doubled. Against doctor's advice (amongst other things), Balboa decides he needs one last shot at the one thing that has eluded him all his life - success.

Carl Weathers does a fantastic job of making Apollo Creed look like he is unbeatable, and Burgess Meredith is incredibly convincing in his role as Rocky's trainer. Needless to say, the acting as a whole in this film is incredible.

The thing that really does it for me in these films (especially the first two) is the story of the underdog. A man who has nothing, suddenly has the chance to gain everything. It is truly a story about a million to one shot.

The training scenes are brilliant, and like the other films in this series the music is fantastic.

I feel that the inspiration comes from the strong message sent out in this film - no matter what the odds are, as long as you have heart and desire you can win.

So I would advise anyone to watch this film, as there is something there for everyone.

Go for it Rock!",10,English,1
59,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw3059983/?ref_=tt_urv,2014-07-31,Nostalgia knocks me (tv),"You can see right once that this movie is from the past century as the focus is about hard working, simple people trying to get an happy life and sticking for that to a body of values! For me, this philosophy is indeed the true heart of Rocky and it's really not important if Rocky wins or not. For that, Sly is perfect as he seems to act naturally : big but loving mouth, small but well-educated brain. Talia Shire is his perfect wife as she is this sweet shy mouse who becomes a mother and finally a support in his boxing career. Maybe i turn into a old grouch, but those late 70s movies were also cooler than 2K10 : no CGI, no mobiles and colored fashion as well. Next, whereas actual movies always happen in NYC or LA, this one was shot live in Philadelphia. In conclusion, it's an interesting sequel and at least, a movie that can't be done anymore.",10,English,1
60,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0170461/?ref_=tt_urv,2002-11-27,rated way too low here,"This movie is not significantly inferior to the original, and both belong in the top 250.  It is the quintessential American film, the story of the underdog. Rocky II is merely the realization of Rocky's dream in the original.  They are really two parts of the same movie.  I would rate this film slightly below its predecessor, but not even a full rating point. Granted, Rocky III and V were bad, but Rocky II was great.  (Rocky IV was pretty good, too--probably a 7.5 to 8).",10,English,1
61,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw1083451/?ref_=tt_urv,2005-05-19,My favourite Rocky film,"God I love this film. The best rocky in my opinion and such a great sequel. It starts exactly where the first one ends. Grabs the audience, as a sequel should, by showing again the fight from Rocky I and then developing the characters further. Whether Apollo frustrated by only just winning, Rocky and Adrian as they marry and have a child or Mickey spending that time with Rocky in the chapel. The tenderness between R and A is just wonderful. Unlike some directors they just keep the romance simple and I just love the innocence of their relationship. Him a lowly boxer, she a dour shop girl but they love each other and that's all the need. The training sequences are brilliant, making you wanting to punch the air when they've finished. The fight is great, unrealistic maybe but exciting nonetheless. My favourite scene though is right at the end. Everyone slates it but it always brings a genuine tear to my eye. He's beaten Apollo and achieved his dreams but the only thing important to him is showing this to his wife. The emotion of his 'Yo Adrian, I did it' is just wonderful, like a young boy wanting to show off to his mother. Rocky has been through hell but all he wants is his wife to be proud of him. Mesmerising and touching.",10,English,1
62,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0170427/?ref_=tt_urv,2000-06-23,My favorite movie,"In my humble opinion, this is the greatest action movie ever filmed.  From the scene where Adrian says, ""I want you to win"" until the final seconds of the film, goosebumps are unavoidable.

Please help!",10,English,3
65,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw3350070/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-11-06,"A good sequel , and an OK movie to the original best film!","Rocky II (1979) the sequel to the success of the first Rocky (1976) film, is my at least favorite movie. It is a wonderful movie continuing the story a total worth of time. It is an OK movie for me. 

Here are the reason why is my at least favorite Rocky film: He earns a little money spends all what he earned, he stinks at the commercials, he can't read, he can't get a job, he is not allowed to fight anymore because Adrian is so selfish and doesn't let him. She is not trying to protect him, she is so selfish and she doesn't want him to fight. She is putting him down. Apollo Creed keeps insulting Rocky, Rocky starts working in the gym and he keeps getting humiliated him self twice. Once in the commercials and second in the gym. The first hour is getting boring and slowly goes , the second hour is paced when he starts training the rest sucks. He doesn't train hard over guilt of Adrian than she falls into coma and he doesn't train anymore. I am wondering how he even lasted 15.rounds and won the title if he stopped training. Everything that Apollo cared in this movie was to get a revenge. This movie is not inspiring it is a good sequel but it is just not inspiring. Rocky becomes a janitor in Mick's gym, Apollo keeps insulting Rocky with words like APOLLO CREED vs. THE Italian CHICKEN,"" with a cartoon picture of Creed grabbing and choking a Rocky-headed chicken. People from the gym was laughing at Rocky and he just ignored them. Adrian put down Rocky, even Mick put him down. Rocky asked him to train him again and Mick reject and put him down. ""Creed would have caved in the whole side of your face. Now, forget it, kid. You got the heart, but you ain't got the tools no more."" Tool's no more? Rocky has a heart so stop putting him down. Apollo and his guy were keep insulting him with a bum.

Mick keeps insulting him, finally against Adrian's will Rocky accept the fight, but he starts training over Adrian's quilt and than he quit training. Adrian fall's in come and he stop training that is stupid! He wanted to gave up Everything for Adrian! Trough whole film there are no boxing matches or any boxing fights, only the rematch between Rocky and Apollo that's it. In all Rocky's there are more boxing matches than one, in this we see only one fight. On the commercials the director keeps insulting Rocky because he can not read. He get's fired from his job as a meat packer. I am sorry people but Rocky II is my at least favorite sport drama film. Too much drama in it, slow pacing and field with boredom.

Things I do like in the film: I love the training and fight sequences. I love the music score by Bill Conti - ""Overture"", the music that Bill Conti wrote was perfect and they fit to the film. I love the opening scene when, the story picks up where the first movie left off. Rocky goes to a hospital after his fight with Apollo and Apollo demands a rematch. I love the hospital scene, I really love how Rocky is praising Apollo and him, saying they both did great. The last fight between Rocky and Apollo was filed with heart. Stallone did not insult Carl Weathers character but he made both of the characters an equal opponents and Apollo lost for one second the title. The fight for the world champion ship was awesome. I love how Rocky was struggling and was trying to find a job, I love that. I love one man's real life human's drama portraying on screen. I love how Mick was training him. I love his methods of training. I love that film is set in the 70's and I love Apollo training sequences. I also love how Tony Duke motivated Apollo in the ring. I also love that no one dies in this movie and Rocky wins the title the champion of the whole world on the end of the movie.

The are a lot of moments I love in this film and a lot of moments I despise and I don't like in this movie.

In the aftermath of his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) attempts to lead a peaceful life with his new bride, Adrian (Talia Shire). The fame and fortune from the match soon runs scarce and to make ends meet, Rocky agrees to a re-match with Apollo.

That is the main plot. I think Sylvester Stallone did a wonderful job writing and directing this job. The rating I give to this film is 7/10 because the film was a wonderful follow that told the whole story to end.

Rocky II is a 1979 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the sequel to the 1976 film Rocky, and was the last installment in the film series that was distributed solely by United Artists.

The highlight of the movie is music director ""Bill Conty"".Even till date the music has soul IN EVERY SINGLE FRAME.Sylvester Stallone has done awesome both in acting and directing the film.He had showed all the stuff in this movie.I am sure that he will be more happy with this movie compared to other four series.Second part of ROCKY has extraordinary music scored by Bill Conti.Sylvester Stallone has done great acting in this movie.All over the best movie of alltime.Sylvester Stallone has proved to be great actor with this movie.",10,English,1
67,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw1192366/?ref_=tt_urv,2005-10-12,"Same Story, Both Continued AND Re-told","I'm old enough to remember the thrill of seeing each of the ""Rocky"" films during their original, theatrical runs. The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.

It's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.

It's a toss up which movie, ""Rocky"" or ""Rocky II,"" asks us to suspend disbelief more. In ""Rocky,"" we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.

Soap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize ""Rocky II"" because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, ""punch drunk"" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.

With a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean ""a fighter"" in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.

Adrian's bit of drama is the single ""problem"" with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.

It's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.

The story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet. Enjoy!",10,English,5

The camera caresses. The eye lingers. There is often visible emotion in the movement of the eye. This needs to be added to that class. To my mind, there are only three elements: Dumb but lovable and enthusiastic commitment from halfway until the end, after self-doubts. This time we have it accompanied with prayer.

These two elements are not worth watching.

And then you have the fight, which here you can skip to 1:42 into the thing. It is the whole thing. this is where the camera starts to embrace. The in-ring camera is missing this time; all the shots are from outside the ring, probably six or eight cameras. It fails. This is where Scorsese steps in and does it right, one of the few things I celebrate him for.

The only excuse for this is to substitute the appreciation of ability to take a punch for true valor, or any other admirable trait. Ostensibly Rocky did this for his wife, but we do not believe that for a second. We know who he loves.

Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.

Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene. 

Rocky II is more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene.

Not content with his victory though, the black guy wants to beat him again. Because one victory isn't enough. He wants another one.

The white guy isn't really up for it though. He'd rather take the safer route. But after being rejected by the entertainment industry and being victimized by organized labor, he finds he has no choice but to fight the black guy .

The black guy is infuriated by how close the white guy came to beating him the first. It's all he can think about. He can't stand the thought that a white guy might be tougher than him. He's so consumed by it, in fact, that he finds himself compelled to play by the white guys rules. Victory is easily within his grasp. All he has to do is be strategic. But the black dude chooses not to be strategic. He decides that even though there are rules to the game they're playing, if he can't beat the white guy in a contest of sheer will, he deserves to lose.

The hospital scene where Adrian wakes up from a coma and goes ""Win!Win!"" might be the most embarrassing moment of the entire franchise, and keep in mind ""Rocky V"" exists. That's not really the biggest problem though, what bothers me more is that this one just so soullessly copies the original. I know all these sequels have the same premise, but most of them at least get different locations, opponents or other awesome new elements. This one has Rocky fighting Apollo Creed again, right after a training montage that you could pass of as stock footage from the first one. Why still the relatively high rating then? I don't really have an answer to that, apart from that it's ""Rocky"" damn it.",6,English,3
82,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw2473492/?ref_=tt_urv,2011-08-13,"Steady, if rocky in its trajectory; this first sequel just about holds its own without necessarily delivering that knockout blow the first one did.","We arrive at the first Rocky sequel recalling that the 1976 serial Oscar winning, and quite magical, first Rocky film was first and foremost a gritty; street-set drama about two people falling in love. The charm of it was observing a hulking and somewhat brutish, although measured, man whom exuded confidence but found it difficult to find the right words falling in with an equally young women whose eloquence happened to be one of her qualities, but whose shy characteristic made it difficult for her to truly connect with other people. Mingling around in the background was this boxing match, and an egotistical champion in the sport challenging a wild-card to a bout to prove he could, in a literal sense, just about beat anybody. It was the sports movie which wasn't actually a sports movie; a film finishing with a 'big sporting showdown' in which the only real victory was the two leads figuring out that they'd quite like to spend a lot more of their time with one another.

Rocky II kicks off with the final round of that fight, the titular Rocky's duel with an African-American heavyweight to whom he looses by the narrowest of margins. There is an unhinged inferring that that's what 1976's Rocky was all about; a fitting sentiment to begin proceedings when we observe this sequel is mostly all about the fight and the sports which formulates therein between the two, when allowing it to just blur into a more interesting tale, as was in the first film, is all the more engaging. That said, and by the time this first sequel is in full swing, one would have to be rather grizzled; rather sniffy to truly detest Rocky II - like the protagonist at the core of this edition, it is a tough film to love but an easy film to just slot into and generally root for.

When we begin, it is in the aftermath of the monstrous encounter between the proverbial underdog and the established champ: Stallone's Rocky Balboa and Carl Weathers' Creed, fittingly named Apollo as he seemingly reigns down over all around him and within his field. They are treated for the previous night's injuries, and stay in a situation of hospitalisation in the same institute. Around them lie a flurry of fans and press personnel, Rocky's newfound fame seeing an array of autograph hunters desiring interactions with the guy and his name on a piece of paper. Rocky states there and then that he's retired from the sport, a knock-on affect which results in his brother-in-law, manager and close friend Paulie (Young) to veer away and back to the illegal way of life that plagued Rocky's prior existence. It is additionally a decision that, once out of the hospital, sees Rocky revert to what his previous status was before this overnight thrusting into stardom; that is to say, to remain steady with sweetheart Adrian (Shire) and garnering whatever work he can to pay for the expensive gifts and great deal of love he wishes to lavish upon her.

In spite of his victory, Creed happens to want a rematch for reasons that are later revealed to be much more personnel to him this time round than the initial entry's blind egotism, and we feel a little more for him here. Rocky goes on to engage Adrian; an instance instigated during a surreal happening at an open-plan zoo under six inches of snow, in which the lone wildlife occupant of the place appears to be a tiger prowling around in his den. As Rocky and Adrian turn to leave, marriage proposal successfully in-tow, we observe the tiger emblem on the back of Rocky's jacket and sync it up with how out of place the zoo's tiger appeared; the sentiment inferring Rocky as a man having turned his back on the boxing world to do labour work, whilst keeping himself out of the limelight, is prominent and he appears under this guise as out of sorts with the nature of this existence, just as the tiger in the snow appeared to.

We realise before Rocky that his spending ways cannot be supplemented by his meat stacking profession, nor his temperamental nature of trying to shoot TV adverts with equally temperamental directors. He realises coming back out of retirement is the only option, and we are weary of such a decision; weary of Creed's own apparent dedication to right-wrongs; weary of what Rocky has on the line to loose, specifically his sight in one eye and his family of Adrian as well as a newborn son whom arrives as the pressure cooker intensifies. We are weary of Rocky's own dedication, and whether he is genuinely transferring back to a life as a boxer once more out of fondness for the sport or if it is for a cash injection; made weary by his trainer Mickey's (Meredith) deduction, and it's a deduction we trust, that Creed will near-enough kill him if they were to fight again. It is a moment captured quite wonderfully by Stallone's positioning of his character in a doorway, as his trainer stands just outside and his wife on the stairs fearing for his health: the mind has been made up, and Rocky proceeds through the portal and back into his old world away from what's homely and safe. The film is not without merit; its final duel is constructed edifyingly, but its training montages are shot with too much intensity given the material, and the whole thing is too self-aware of its own core dramatics when a fourth-wall breaking telecast greets us ringside upon entry to the stadium – we are here, in this sequel, to see the fight and only the fight. Regardless, we're behind the characters enough to want them to succeed; Rocky himself states at one point that he'd be nothing and nowhere without the lovely Adrian – we'd be at a loss in backing him if he weren't.",6,English,0

It always is tricky and a huge risk to create a sequel and live up to the expectation especially when the first one is loved worldwide to this level and acclaimed by the critics and they did it, again; its just as good as the first one. Rocky II is sensationally upbeating and exhilarating with enough content for 2 hours of runtime; even though being predictable, is still fun and filled with all the clichéd drama. Sylvester Stallone's smart idea by picking it up right where it was left off works as a charm and gives enough depth to the characters and the plotline. And he stretches himself too, as a director and writer but also as an actor giving enough range to stage himself up along with a great supporting cast. Rocky II connects with the audience more than the previous one allowing the audience to root and even cheer for the protagonist which shows the excellence of the director on execution but again the choreography seemed a bit loose.",5,English,3
84,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0170490/?ref_=tt_urv,2004-07-14,"Too slow, too boring, too average to be considered a worthy sequel.","This movie is not bad but it is simply too much of a repeating session of the first movie.

The movie moves very slow and only really starts to become interesting after an hour. Luckily the movie begins to get pace a lot from the moment Rocky begins training again, which are also the best parts of the movie. The drama in the beginning just didn't do it for me, mainly because you already knew how it all would end.

I'm sorry to say but Sly can't act. But still he is perfect for the role and I don't think the movie would have been any better without him. Somehow he still brings much live to the movie and the character. Talia Shire is good and believable as Rocky's shy girlfriend/wife.

But what am I talking about drama and acting skills? ""Rocky"" of course is all about boxing and everything else in the movie doesn't really matter. All the boxing scene's are amazing and I'm not just talking about the end fight but also about the training sessions also helped by Bill Conti's famous musical score which really gets you're adrenaline flowing. The biggest adrenaline rush of the movie is of course the end fight which just couldn't be long enough for me. The movie is worth watching for this alone and the ending actually always keeps bringing tears of joy to my eyes. Yes, I know I'm pathetic. The ending is of course totally over the top; the music, the slow motion, the crowed, the tension but I love it!

Worth watching for the end fight alone.

85,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw0170444/?ref_=tt_urv,2001-12-27,"Predictable, But Fun","Rocky II represents a decent enough follow-up to the original movie. The primary problem with it is its predictability. Rocky struggles to make a go of it without boxing, but we know from the very beginning that he's going to get back into the fight game. Otherwise, there's no movie. As in the first movie, the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed is magnificently choreographed (although - and I have this problem with the entire ""Rocky"" series - heavyweights just don't punch like that; at least not in any fight I've ever seen) but, again, the result is rather predictable (although how the result comes about is a bit of a surprise.) But one of the great things about the original was the unpredictability of the fight. Would Rocky win or lose? As I recall when I watched the original for the first time, I really didn't know. This time, you know. I mean, the result has to be the way it turns out.

The performances here are decent. Sylvester Stallone was born to play Rocky Balboa. There's no doubt about that. He puts on a believable enough portrayal of a frustrated ex-fighter, unable to make his way, with a wife who doesn't want him fighting. Carl Weathers provides a fuller look at Apollo Creed, battling his personal demons after the embarrassment of his disastrous first match with Rocky. Talia Shire was I thought weaker in this movie. Adrian came across to me as more window-dressing than substance, and Burgess Meredith continued to be the epitome of the gruff old trainer.

Predictability aside, I enjoyed the movie, although it was definitely not up to the standard of the original.

The champion's vanity would shame Narcissus and he rationalises that Rocky's 15 round slog was a bit of a fluke, after all this is a man with an I.Q so low that only someone with Aspurger's syndrome can calculate all the decimals. If he can get him back in the ring for a rematch this should become obvious to everyone. That's everyone except us of course who could tell Creed he was setting himself up to be less Apollo 11, more 13 but nevertheless the stage is set for yet enough climatic confrontation. As we've already seen most of this movie in the first instalment it's only necessary for Stallone to make some minor modifications. His wife gives birth but goes into a coma prompting Rocky to lose his focus on the fight. Mickey reassures him by saying things like ""You're gonna get KILLED"" while Creed pumps iron and laughs off suggestions that he may be making a mistake, and so on and so on... Eventually we do get to the juice as Adrian wakes up and tells Rocky that for the benefit of the film she'll drop her objections and let him fight. At this stage all thats left is for that fanfare to come on, Rocky to play chase with some kids from the neighbourhood and the throttling of some poor chicken and we're off! 

The second film lacks the freshness of the first but it's still easily digestible entertainment. As its unthinkable that Rocky could loose THIS time there's also the inevitable win to look forward to and although hardly a tour de force from a directorial point of view, Stallone does at least acquit himself well in the staging of the fight scenes and shows sufficient acumen in pushing the right audience buttons.

87,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw3322651/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-09-24,No Match To Its Groundbreaking Predecessor But It's Still Fun & Entertaining,"The second instalment in the Rocky series, Rocky II follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in the first picture and follows Rocky Balboa who, after his loss to Creed, retires from boxing and gets busy enjoying his new found fame but after failing in multiple facets of life, he returns to the boxing arena to face Creed, who's been consistently goading Balboa for a rematch.

Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky II stays faithful to the spirit of the original but is highly erratic with its theme & characters. Rocky's inability to handle his sudden fame & money in an effective manner is the story's core element but it's not well executed. Much of the picture feels like plodding for we already know what awaits in the end and can't wait for that final battle, which fortunately is as impressive as it was in the previous chapter.

The set pieces do benefit from a bigger budget, Stallone's direction isn't very good but it's still passable for the most part, Camera-work is best during the training & boxing segments, Its 119 minutes of runtime is excessive for the story it packs in, Bill Conti delivers another sensational soundtrack that's in tune with the last feature while the performances from its entire cast is a step down when compared to their input in Rocky, although it isn't a major departure.

On an overall scale, Rocky II heads into the right direction and tackles the right themes but due to Stallone's inexperience as a director, it isn't able to address & execute them properly and is certainly no match to its groundbreaking predecessor. The final act is pretty much its saving grace for without it, this would've been a highly frustrating experience. Predictable but also true to its origins, Rocky II may not deliver the same high thrills but it manages to be fun & entertaining in bits n pieces, and is worth a shot.",5,English,3

Although neither of them initially wanted a rematch events soon overtake both of them which results in Apollo Creed basically having to challenge Rocky in order to regain the respect of the public. Rocky, on the other hand, finds that life after the match with Apollo doesn't go as planned and he soon becomes faced with mounting debts and a pregnant wife by the name of ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire) to support. That said, rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it pretty much followed the same pattern as the first movie except that it was even more slow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie by any means. But I don't believe it was on the same level as its predecessor and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6,English,1

Rocky II works the same way one of those Jean-Claude Van Damme tournament movies work, it's appeal is spread over the training montage and of course in the fight sequence itself. Rocky II does have some appeal still in the characters but the first one was far more interesting in this approach and although the characters are still fresh the main reason Rocky II is enjoyable is mainly due to the reasons I mention.

One: the final fight is actually a bit better than the first film.

People begin to accuse Apollo of fixing the fight and of being a disgrace to the profession, prompting him to challenge Rocky to a rematch. Meanwhile, Rocky has retired from boxing. He marries Adrian and has a son, but he's having trouble finding a job. Pretty soon it becomes apparent that the only way he can support his family is if he goes back to boxing, so he accepts Creed's challenge and begins training to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky II stays true to the feel of the first film, making it one of the better sequels.

Rocky is the single best underdog story ever captured on film, and it was a huge success, and seeing as Rocky lost by split decision at the end of the first film, it was a good idea to make a sequel. Sylvester Stallone wrote and directed this movie, and he made it a lot like the first film, with some added stuff. However, there seemed to be a little of the finesse of the first film missing. It didn't have exactly the same feel. I think it was that the fight wasn't that important in the first film but this movie is all about the fight. This movie is the last good drama in the series before it turned into an action series with the 3rd installment.

All of the actors from the first film return to their roles, and everyone does just as good, although Rocky comes across as vastly uneducated in some scenes whereas he seemed to at least have a high school diploma in the first film.

This movie is very similar to the first film with what many people would call a more common and likely ending.

I really enjoyed the first Rocky, and it was obvious from the very first glance that it was not a boxing movie, but rather a drama that involved boxing, much like 8 Mile isn't a movie about rapping, but rather a drama that involves rapping. The sequel is the same thing, and I'm very glad that it is, since that allows non-boxing-fans like myself to enjoy it. The film picks up exactly where the first one left off, and follows the events of the first film directly. Personally, it felt a little like the plot was mainly made up to make a sequel to the first, but, hey, the film is good, almost as good as the first, so I'm not complaining. It just doesn't seem one hundred percent likely. The plot is good, about as good as the first. It takes off at the beginning, like the first, and remains interesting throughout the entire runtime. The acting and characters are just as good as they were in the first, as pretty much every one of them were in the first as well. The direction lacks a little, which the first didn't, probably due to Stallone taking over directing duties. One thing that bothered me a little was that the end boxing match seemed a little unrealistic, more than the one in the first Rocky, but, like I said, I'm no fan, so I don't know for sure if it is unrealistic. All in all, a worthy sequel to the first, and definitely worth watching for any fan of the first film. I recommend it to fans of the first Rocky, fans of dramas and possibly boxing fans in general. 7/10",7,English,1
95,Rocky 2,http:/review/rw2861435/?ref_=tt_urv,2013-09-01,Entertaining Sequel.,"Sylvester Stallone returns as writer, star, and now director of this exciting sequel that pushes all the expected buttons, and tells the story of how Rocky, despite not wanting a rematch, gives in to the public pressure of champion Apollo Creed, and agrees. He is re-trained by his manager, again played memorably by Burgess Meredith, and also must deal with his growing family(now married to Adrian, with new baby) who really need the money.

Sure this film is totally predictable, the outcome not in doubt, but credit Stallone for shrewdly knowing what his audience would want, and gave it to them in an entertaining film.",7,English,1

Rocky II continues directly from where Rocky ended. Unknown Rocky (Sylvester Stallone, this time also the director) almost won the heavyweigt champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Rocky is now famous, but life continues.

Rocky marries his girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire) and of course Adrian is expecting a baby to born. Doctor forbids Rocky for fighting because of his injured eye, but what else Rocky could do?

Unfortunately , neither ""F.I.S.T."" (which I saw and I think is nice) or ""Paradise alley"" came close to the success of Avildsen's movie. Stallone was kinda forced to return to Balboa , if he didn't want his career to end.

It's hard to think something new in the movie about boxing . ""Rocky 2"" certainly lacks the freshness of original and feels like a copy . Once again Rocky has trouble in everyday life , there is training montage (hell , TWO training montages) and epic fight at the end. The movie does gets too sappy at times . The movie doesn't have anything to add to characters audience already met.

It doesn't mean that it's a bad movie . ""Rocky 2"" feels very realistic in terms of story . Loosing hard earned money , failing into obscurity, becoming a sell out – those a serious real life problems that do feel important here. Stallone is director here and he handles some of the dramatic scenes really well ( for example Balboa talking with Mick about going back). The training scenes feel inspirational and the main fight is exciting. There are some good dialogues here and jokes (the talk in the church about condominium).

""Rocky 2"" doesn't comes close to the first movie. It isn't that well made and it's not that deep. It doesn't feel inspired . Still, it's a solid craftsmanship and a good sequel overall. I give it 7/10.",7,English,3

The actors turn in fine performances and the story is satisfactory.  However, this time around, the training sequences are a little bit déjà vu, and the climaxing match between Rocky and Apollo is not as amusing.  Has its share of fun, though, and still packs a punch.

103,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw3527104/?ref_=tt_urv,2016-08-17,Rocky III: An American Tradition,"After the recap of the fight from the previous movie, Rocky III opens with a montage which begins with fireworks and giant light up sign of Rocky as if to say ""Welcome to the 80's!""; a decade when everything was larger than life. The song of choice is Eye of Tiger, the montage is edited like an MTV music video and Rocky even appears on The Muppet Show; and all that merchandise, me want!

Rocky III is ridiculously entertaining while still managing to have thematic substance. Rocky is no longer struggling with fame. A man who couldn't film a simple commercial in Rocky II is now making all sorts of endorsements. He could barely drive a car in Rocky II, now he can now drive with ease. Rocky has also become a more intelligent man instead of the dum dum he was in first two movies. Not to mention does he looks different, very handsome I might add and in such physical shape. I think Stallone looks like Al Pacino here, especially when wearing a suit.

Rocky III brought the series in a different direction, distant from the first two movies. But despite Rocky's wealth and fame, Rocky III is not a movie which cheapens out. The primary theme of the movie is about Rocky's fame making him soft or as Mickey puts it, ""You got civilised"". Once Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters his seemingly perfect bubble of a life is burst; ""You wake up after a few years, thinking you're a winner, but you're not, you're really a loser"". This continues the series theme of being semi-autobiographical of Stallone's own life as the movie examines what fame and fortune can do to a person. Adrian's role is smaller is time round although her character still sees an evolution as the famous lifestyle has taken away her shyness and made her more outspoken and pretty hot too I might add. Just listen to the words of motivation she gives Rocky on the beach; a far cry from the Adrian in the first movie.

Even when Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters prior to his first fight with Clubber Lang, Rocky is training in the most superficial gym. It's full of photographers and visitors, musicians are playing and merchandise is being sold. Unsurprisingly he gets the worst beating of his life at the hands of Clubber Lang. The solution to Rocky getting his so-called ""eye of the tiger"" back; get away from the superficiality of his wealthy lifestyle and back to the nitty-gritty. As Apollo Creed puts it, ""Man, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger man, the edge! And the only way to get it back is to go back to the beginning; you know what I'm saying?"". I stick by these words as some of the wisest words I've heard uttered in a motion picture. Whenever you lose your mindset of determination whether physically or mentality, go back to where you first started in order to reclaim it. Rocky III humanises Apollo Creed with Rocky and Apollo becoming friends being a great spin on the story. I always think of his intense shouting of ""There is no tomorrow!"" whenever I need some motivation.

The hypnotic, uneasy music which plays when Rocky is training poorly under Apollo and stuck with the threat of living with failure reminds me of Bernard Herman's score to Vertigo in possibly the most uneasy scenes in the series. Likewise, the scene of Paulie in the arcade has to be the most surreal scene in the entire series in which he throws a bottle pinball machine in slow motion complete with odd sound effects; it's an image which doesn't leave your head.

Mr. T as Clubber Lang, oh man! What a beast! A true larger than life villain with outbursts of immensely entertaining lightning fast dialogue; he sure has a way with words with such a violent temper and high levels of anger. You do not want to be stuck in an elevator with this guy. Which raises the question; is Clubber responsible for the death of Mickey by pushing him to the side? Yet even close to death Mickey can still inspire with scenery-chewing words of motivation; his death being one of the series most emotional moments. The boxer vs. wrestler charity fight on the other hand between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) has nothing to do with the rest of the movie but dam is it entertaining. It's so over the top with such intense pain on display. The referee and police officers are thrown to the side, the audience is assaulted and even Paulie gets in on the action (I do love those bits of humour Paulie provides).

The final fight in Rocky III is the only in ring fight in the series which takes place in real time until Creed. Meanwhile, the final scene of the movie is such fun, with Rocky and Apollo playing off each other which along with the training montage gives off some homoerotic vibes along the way with sweaty, shirtless, muscular men in tank tops as well as men hugging and jumping in the sea.

Also, the film's trailer refers to Rocky III as an ""American tradition"". What's the tradition? Hollywood sequels?",10,English,3

And that point is from the time Rocky became the Champion. his life turned from being about the streets. And being about one of the people to being a celebrity . Rocky hasn't sold out. He was swept up by all the fame and all the changes fame makes, More money bigger house more people knowing who you are. It feeds the Ego. And Rocky has quietly slipped into this trap, But Rocky is still fighting. Defending the Championship against ten fighters. Rocky has become a icon. the public loves him. Then a shadow looms over the happiness like a thunder cloud at a family picnic. Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is a hungry fighter. A top ranked contender he demands a shot at the title. But in the meantime he destroys his way to the top. undefeated. and angry he confronts Rocky at a Civic unveiling of a statue honoring Rocky. angry Rocky accepts and Gives Clubber his shot. but Mickey mysteriously walks away. Leaving Rocky hurt and angry. Once they are home he confronts Mickey who tells him the truth. the beating that Apollo gave him should have killed him. Anymore fights of that type would have. So Mickey working behind the scenes found good strong fighters. fighters that would give Rocky a good fight but not devastate him like clubber. Rocky is crushed. Those ten title defenses he believes are fake set ups just to keep the Title Longer. Rocky begs Mickey to train him .Mickey agrees. Rocky trains poorly. clubber Trains Hard and on the day of the fight two things happen that'll impact Rocky forever. The first is during a brawl between both fighters on route to the ring. Mickey suffers a heart attack and dies. And Apollo Creed while being a guest of honor is treated like trash by Clubber. Clubber destroys Rocky, And the Championship becomes Clubber Lang's.

To do that Rocky must go back to Apollo's roots and to Apollo's trainer Duke. while Apollo and Duke train the body. Adrian trains the mind and spirit. Rocky scared and angry Soon becomes once again Rocky the Warrior and during the rematch not only beats Clubber but destroys him. Rocky has come back. He has now learned the lessons he needed. Never forget where you come from never forget what drives you and never forget the people that love you and support you.

Rocky III some say is easily the best Rocky. And Every Rocky does have a point . the first Rocky had him as a club fighter a man no one paid attention to. and a man destined to be forgotten. until he was given a chance.A shot at the big time Rocky had a dream and it was simply to be standing at the end. dreams are worth fighting for. Rocky II was about not forgetting about what's the most important things in life are. while pursuing your dreams. Rocky III it's point is simple. Never forget who you are and never lose yourself in superficial things be honest to yourself at least.

Stallone once said that Rocky III was about how fame changed him. and how people had changed around him it was as Stallone said very surreal. Like Alice falling down the Rabbit hole into Wonderland .

And he captures that perfectly here. Creating a classic Rocky film that can easily take its place among the best.

But now i realize that those movies were much older and if we watch them with contemporary eyes, we see that they are really forerunner of the modern American movies ! 

First of all, if Sly hasn't invented sequels, he is among the first authors to believe in it : back then, we had only Coppola (Godfather), Lucas (Star Wars) and a few others Next, he is also the first author to illustrate scenes with just a song and no dialogues, and what a song : « eye of the tiger ». Still today, it's a rock classic and this song editing is used by everyone now ! Next, as a director, i found Sly has great inspirations with striking angles, close-up, news editing, all things that we see everyday now but back then were original. As an author, we can say whatever but Rocky has a special place in our heart as the movies are true to deep values : efforts, getting up after a blow, friendship, marital life, education, citizenship Here, Rocky is still bound to Philly, he spends some nice time with his son, he has to deal even more with celebrities and fame, and for sure, the punching winner is also a crying man ! But we got also minorities friendship and one more time, there is not a lot movies with that question !

This movie quite possibly is the most entertaining one of the bunch. Even though there is some drama once more, this movie is just mainly entertaining. Main reason for this is because of the 'main villain' Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. Oh man what a character!

The boxing scene's look better than ever and the movie features quite some matches. You will just never grow tired of those spectacular filmed boxing matches!

The story itself is actually also quite solid. I just love how they made Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) fit in this movie again. The drama, even though it of course all is very predictable is handled very well also once more mainly thanks to Talia Shire's acting skills. Sylvester Stallone is acting a bit disappointing in this one...but still he simply just IS Rocky.

Brilliant entertainment!

In my very 1st comment about rocky balboa i talked about how rocky was introduced in my life through an April fool day, this was the movie. At that young as an 8 yrs old , i understood the myth and the ideology of this film. That was the 1st time i saw sly Stallone, and in its 1st appearance he made his place in my heart. When he become too much indulged in the business of money making and fame ,he ignored the advice of his mentor mickey and the fact that he is losing his attitude of being a true fighter, than he is met by clubber lang , a new but vicious , arrogant and aggressive contender and he knocks rocky out easily in second round just like without a fight , also then mickey is gone forever. Rocky is so devastated and broken down he even now despises his own self. So much frustrated at this time that he cant put it out of his mind what happened and what is left for him to live than now he is offered a selfless and generous assistance by an unlikely ally. His old nemesis Apollo creed. Now being Apollo on his side all rocky has to do to put himself all together and again live for the glory and prestige he lost in the ring with that championship, Coz that the the only way he can live with his own self, by following the phenomena Apollo creed introduced to him as the eye of the tiger. This was the best movie as far boosting your morale and spirit in the whole rocky series. Mr T as clubber lang was an excellent discovery by Sylvester Stallone, as here he also proved his directional skills , also as he discovered Dolph lundgren for rocky 4.

119,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw3348405/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-11-03,Rise and fall from grace - undoubtedly tied best classic movie with IV!,"Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. It is my third favorite Rocky film. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.

Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. 

Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said ""Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning."" That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! 

Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! 

I love this film it is my third best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky IV. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. 

Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. 

Rocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.

He'll knock you out inside of three rounds Rock.,"The film Rocky 3 was definitely, in my opinion, the best Rocky film of all time. Some people might argue with this by saying that Rocky 1 was the best as it showed the rise of Rocky in boxing and the romantic side from when he fell in love with Adrian, others might prefer Rocky 2 for when Rockys son was born, doing his TV commercial advertisement and when he became the Heavy weight champion of the world, while others might prefer Rocky 4 after the coming of boxer Ivan Drago, the sadness of Apollo Creed dying and when Rocky travelled to Russia. 

Although most of the Rocky films were spectacular, I have to say that Rocky 3 compared to the other Rocky films had so much more to offer compared to the other Rocky films as it was action packed and ongoing excitement all the way through the film. It had Rockys boss Micky dying, Mr.T and Hulk Hogan(and Wrestle-mania),the building of Rockys statue, it had Rocky losing everything and then getting it all back again and the brilliant one line quotes (ie. When the newscaster said to Clubber lang ""Whats your prediction for tomorrow nights fight""... Clubber Lang replies ""Prediction""...Newscaster replies ""Yes Prediction""... Clubber Lang replies... PAIN!! and from when Clubber Lang says to Rockys wife ""If you bring your pretty little self on down to my apartment tonight, I will show you a real man etc...) and not to mention the fact that this film had three fights while every other Rocky film had a maximum of two fights. Also for Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone)to fight in the ring two hard man icons such as Mr. T and Hulk Hogan is quite a spectacular challenge for one Rocky film to offer as no other Rocky film has ever matched up to it.

He puts himself in front of the camera more than anybody else, sure--it's what ""Rocky"" fans want--but he's there to be pummeled and humiliated in close-up, to get his audience fighting mad. This way his revenge on the enemy will ultimately be that much more sweet. It's an old hat trick, passed down the Hollywood line, and Stallone doesn't even bother reinventing it, he just plows right ahead as if he were doing something new. Maybe he feels he's demonstrating a new form of manipulation, but it's hard to laugh it off when supporting players Talia Shire and Burt Young are used so pettily and cheaply (one big scene each). Stallone's Rocky Balboa matches jabs with Mr. T. as ""Clubber Lang"", who doesn't so much box as he does pound. This entry in the ""Rocky"" saga goes so far as to make Lang a killer.

After the death of a dear friend and personal trainer, Rocky and Apollo team up together to train Rocky to get him back competing. This is a story about loss and about trying to get back onto one's feet again after dealing with loss.

127,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw3218837/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-04-12,Even more of the same - formulaic,"Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.

Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.

Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.

Rocky III pretty much just follows the same formula. Change the guy Rocky has to fight, rinse and repeat. Only difference here is that we have two fights - one in mid-movie, one at the end.

I like the idea of a serialized account of Rocky's life, but this doesn't really add anything original to the series.",4,English,1

There is a sense of wanting more for the character but at this point it seems obvious that they are stretching their way down the road where box office is given more importance than quality of it. Rocky III is flat out predictable and a typical sport movie filled with cliched action sequences to complete the run time of the movie. Sylvester Stallone seems to be working hard on it since being aware of the platform he has got and gets a good supporting cast on screen. Rocky III is of course made for the audience with more action sequences and fan boy moments but looses the touch of originality and the soul of it.",5,English,3

It also looks bad. Real bad. Not sure that's Stallone's fault; two has its own issues, but it doesn't look like the throwaway this one does. In all, it's a corny and predictable collection of training montages trying to disguise itself as a movie. And before you say, ""But Matt, that's just what Rocky movies are!"".

131,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw3322668/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-09-24,I Pity The Fool Who Green-Lighted It!,"The third instalment in the Rocky series, the story of Rocky III is set 4 years after the events of the previous chapter and follows Rocky Balboa who, after many successful title defences & his ever increasing fame, is strongly considering retirement but falls into depression after losing the title to a rookie boxer and turns to a former enemy to get himself back in the ring.

Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky III is a mediocre sequel that takes the series into a different direction and features a more campy tone that soon becomes very annoying. The screenplay isn't good at all for the plot wastes time on sequences that don't even play any relevant role in the final outcome, not much is added to reprising characters while the new ones are instantly forgettable.

There isn't much to talk about its technical aspects for none of the elements have anything new to offer and while its reduced runtime is a welcome change, the final fight this film was building itself to ends up sooner than expected and on that scale, it's disappointing. As far as performances go, everyone fails to make their mark while Mr. T leaves no stone unturned to make his character one of the lamest ever to step into the ring.

On an overall scale, Rocky III might be fun for those who had a good time with Rocky II but it marks a departure from what the first film was all about. There are a couple of interesting moments in the picture but most of it is forgettable. Stallone's input both in front & behind the camera continues its downfall, the dialogues are pretty much garbage, the finale fails to live up to its hype, and although Bill Conti's score feels repetitive, it's the only element that fares as per expectations. I pity the fool who green-lighted it.",5,English,1
132,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw4751180/?ref_=tt_urv,2019-03-30,The only reason...,"...why I gave this movie four stars is because of three reasons:

1. To me, it was just not that entertaining. Stallone looks more like an early 80s model rather than a boxer, as if he were just walking off the set of a movie with his perfect hair, untouched by sweat or the elements. It just seems to me like the movie itself was hastily put together with bits thrown in for time fillers.

2. The treatment of the film had a few cruel edges. Notably the way Mr. T's character roughing up Burgess Meredith's, causing Meredith to have a heart attack and die. Okay, I understand Meredith was 75 when this was filmed, but to put his character at the form of being shoved at his age traumatized me somewhat, especially knowing at that time my own grandfather was in his 80s, and it made me think if this would have happened to him. Just not my style to see elderly people face a cold, disheartening death at the hands of a bully, no matter what.

And 3. I just don't like Mr. T...period. I don't know if it's just a character act and he's just a good guy at heart, but acting like a bad-ass turns me completely off...and not showing any remorse for your actions has no appeal to me. Maybe I'm just too old these days to say that, but back then, I was in my early teens and it just made no sense to me.

Now you see why I gave it the rating I did. And it's my opinion why.",4,English,3
133,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw2667428/?ref_=tt_urv,2012-09-01,The series gets a lot weaker with this one,"The Rocky saga continues with Sylvester Stallone in the director's chair again for Rocky III. Keeping with the Rocky formula, Rocky III opens with the end of Rocky II, where Rocky wins the fight against Apollo Creed and claims the heavyweight champion title. We then jump forward three years with the help of your typical Rocky montage where Rocky becomes a huge celebrity and the absolute pride of Philladelphia. However, when a new young challenger comes along, Rocky has no choice but to face him. This challenger? None other than Clubber Lange, played by the infamous Mr. T in his film debut. In the fight Rocky takes a brutal beat down from Clubber, and afterwards looks to former rival, Apollo Creed to train him in order to restore his confidence.

I have to admit, for me, watching a Rocky film is a lot of fun. It's empowering, inspiring, and always seems to be a great experience. But, as much as I enjoy a good Rocky flick I can't deny that Rocky III is a pretty half hearted attempt. It feels shoddily thrown together in an attempt to churn out another run of the mill story. The film's flow seems too sped up and doesn't go deep at all. It has some good heartfelt moments, but overall just feels very phoned in. The Rocky films seem to get progressively more predictable and less original. Rocky III offers up nothing new, and it's where the series redundancy really starts to show. I won't say that the previous two films suffer from the third, but Rocky III is definitely very forgettable.

Of course, the film isn't without a few good things. You can expect to see some of your favorite things about Rocky films in Rocky III. You'll be treated to some great montages, even though this film has a total of three I believe, and for a 100 minute runtime this is sort of overdoing it. We also get to see the characters of Rocky, Adrian, and Apollo grow and mature to continue to be ever fascinating characters. Kudos go to Sylvester Stallone to keeping his characters fresh, it's just a shame he couldn't do the same with the storyline. Also, as with the previous two Rocky films, you can expect a rousing climax in Rocky III. It's inspiring and empowering to watch Rocky fight at the end of the film, and it almost makes you forget how mediocre the rest of the film is.

All in all, don't expect much from Rocky III. It's the weakest of the first three films by a long shot, but if you enjoyed the first two then I would say give this one a shot if you haven't satisfied your Rocky fever quite yet. It's not a disaster, but Rocky III is pretty underwhelming.",5,English,1
134,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw1096921/?ref_=tt_urv,2005-06-06,Hit me baby one more time,"And so to the third Rocky in which a complacent Stallone has grown fat on opulence and celebrity and finds himself unprepared for the hungry and you'd have to say insane challenger, Clubber Lang, none other than Mr.T in the first role of a surprisingly undistinguished movie career. Rocky's beaten naturally because his cheque book isn't quite strong enough to cushion Lang's punches and even worse, Lang has roughed up trainer Mickey and caused him to have a fatal heart attack. Such setbacks would dampen the spirits of lesser men and sure enough Balboa slips into a depression and something of an existential crisis. Thankgoodness then for old adversary, turned friend Apollo Creed who tells Rocky to pick himself up, read up on Tigers and take himself to the beach for a bit of homo-erotic horseplay, then on to the ring to teach the new champ a damn good lesson...

Rocky III may be a comment on the promise of the American ideal corrupted by its vast wealth and unrestrained capitalism. Then again that could be nonsense. In Rocky you've got the embodiment of the American dream gone soft and no longer possessing the spirit that was the source of his power and influence. He's reduced to commercial endorsements and expensive suites and even more embarrassingly, Wrestling Exibition fights. He's lost his heart and his self-respect, y'know the kind you only have when you're poor and he needs to get it back because at this point there's still an hour of the film left. The third film is a bit of a weird one because though perfectly watchable its got moments of supreme silliness. All of a sudden Rocky can't get anywhere near a ring without oiling himself up. Creed seems obsessed with the tie-in track and mentions it every five minutes and we learn that the only way to get your respect back is to do imitations of wild animals and jump about in the sand with the spray of the ocean suggestively foaming all over you. We're left with this rather strange situation in which the film is softened by the same commerical pressures that Rocky himself proved susceptible too. It's Rocky now as franchise - product and as a result there's none of the dramatic pretencions of early movies. It's strictly formula which is fine but it might leave you wondering where the series could go after this. Well Russia of course!",5,English,2

But, whatever.

If there was going to be a second addition, this should have been it. With Clubber holding the title and Rocky determined to take it. That would have been fine, but, no...Sly wanted riches. I can relate.

Now, if you can forgive all that, there is fun to be had. It comes by way of Clubber Lang, the most awesome character of all Rocky's opponents. MR T plays this role very well; his best performance of that era. Without Clubber, however, Rocky III does not stand all that well.

A lot of the drama in this one lacks any emotional weight, so I just take this one as some light entertainment for an hour and a half. The main antagonist is very one dimensional, but he is entertaining to watch, even if he is a giant cartoon. Unfortunately, it feels as though this movie just kind of exists when it doesn't need to, but there's still a bit of fun to be had with it. The matches are entertaining, but again, there's hardly any emotional weight behind them, so they are much less thrilling than the final match at the end of the first film.

Look there's Mr. T! Hulk Hogan! Eye of the Tiger! It is a continuation of the story of Rocky's life as he lives the life of a champion with endorsements, riches, glory...but the hunger of his youth all but gone. This is a story about Rocky rediscovering his passion for boxing and it is reasonably entertaining. One thing is clear...this movie is nowhere near the level of the original film, but it holds a certain nostalgia for those of a certain age who grew up with the character. Written and directed by Stallone himself Rocky 3 could have been a decent end to a nice little trilogy. It's entertaining, and the acting is not bad with Burgess Meredith as Mickey coming off the best. Mr. T became a big star after his performance as antagonist Clubber Lang. The best thing you can say about this movie is it wasn't an embarrassment unlike some later entries in the series. I'm looking at you Rocky 4 and 5.",6,English,1
141,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw3659847/?ref_=tt_urv,2017-03-11,Rocky Goes Hollywood...And Loses Himself,"After conquering Apollo Creed and winning the title in the previous film, in this installment Rocky Balboa must face his toughest opponent yet...himself.

For a basic plot summary, ""Rocky III"" continues the inspiring story of pugilist Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). After defending his title numerous times against hand-picked opponents, Rocky seems to have lost that ""eye of the tiger"" he had in the two Creed fights. At the same time, #1 contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T) is hungry for a shot at the strap (training vigorously while Rocky films commercials). This causes dissension in the Balboa ranks, with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and wife Adrian (Talia Shire) trying to protect Rocky for different reasons.

The redeeming portion of this screenplay is the continued character growth of Rocky. For whatever reason (as Sly Stallone had proved himself completely incompetent as a director up to that point), Sly just ""gets"" Rocky and knows how to smartly advance the character.

The problem is that whereas the first two Rocky films use the fight scenes to cap off the drama, this time the drama is few and far between due to the bloated ring time. Nearly half the movie is spent ""in the ring"", and considering the fakey fight scenes, that is not a good thing. Likely because Rocky II was roundly criticized for being too slow to develop, this time the action is fast and furious, though not to the benefit of the overall experience.

Another thing that hurts this series is the terrible casting decisions that is Mr. T. He turns in easily the worst performance of the entire six-film series, and this includes a movie starring Dolph Lundgren. He has no sense of choreography in the boxing scenes, and only issues a series of grunts in the acting department.

Thus, while ""Rocky III"" does enough things right to be watchable, it also does enough tings wrong for me to consider it the worst of the entire franchise.",6,English,1

Rocky 3 deals with Rocky's fame and status rising after his second battle with Apollo Creed. After winning his 10th title defense, Rocky is challenged to a fight by the number one contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Micky reluctantly agrees to help him train for the last time. Mickey undergoes complications before the fight begins, which upsets Rocky. He wants to call off the fight, but Mickey tells him to go out and fight. Rocky's thoughts lie with Mickey as Clubber brutally defeats him in the second round. After the fight, Mickey dies. After the funeral, Rocky enters into a state of depression. Apollo Creed offers to help train Rocky and help him regain his edge. Not my favorite rocky movie, but definitely worth watching.",6,English,1
143,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw1874812/?ref_=tt_urv,2008-05-16,Lighter Rocky makes for a lighter movies,"This is my 3rd Rocky today. I wanted to see how each individual movie was written and directed. This review was started at 8:53pm 16th May 2008.

In this installment, he is beaten by the younger fighter Clubber Lang (Played so ""Gracefully"" by Mr. T). He must then return to the ring one more time (Untill the sequel) and find the ""Eye of The Tiger"".

The film in itself is OK. It does not compare to the brilliance of the first 2 but does work well for the series. It is well acted and well written and directed. Syllone's performance is once again spot on to the character of Rocky.

Overall, the film is good for a view but people who have not seen the first 2 should definitely watch them first. The film holds it own and is and should be considered a good sequel.",6,English,3
144,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw1547353/?ref_=tt_urv,2006-12-17,Lacks The Rocky Feel,"The original ROCKY and, to a lesser extent, ROCKY II, had a certain feel. You knew you were watching something special as the underdog of underdogs endeavored to bleed, sweat and punch his way to the impossible. You could relate to Rocky and da tings he was go-in chrew. He made you feel part of his experience.

That sort of magic is absent in ROCKY III. It's not so much that Rocky has changed, though he has. When we first met him he was a nobody with nothing. In ROCKY II he was struggling to deal with being a somebody with lots of things. Though he tries to again make us believe he's a longshot, Stallone just can't pull it off this time because we know better. And it's not so much that the formula has changed, though it has. The first two films were not really boxing films at all, but human dramas we could all relate to whether we'd ever seen a punching bag or not. ROCKY III makes the mistake of being a boxing movie, largely pushing aside the human elements that made this character an icon.

Well, actually, those factors probably do have something to do with it. As do the disappointing opening and closing matches. In the first, Rocky squares off against loud-mouthed wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in a charity bout. It ranks as the most embarrassing and bizarre occurrence of any ROCKY film as the Hulkster tosses Rock around and goes berserk. In the second, Rocky tries a new strategy of getting his opponent all worked up before delivering the finishing blows. The wonderful suspense of his first big fights are absent. Instead of standing up and cheering, we merely nod at the emergence of the obvious.

Not that ROCKY III is an awful film. When critiqued on its own, forgetting thrills of the past, it certainly has worthwhile qualities. Stallone is good and honest as the hero, and Mr. T (in his film debut) is a treat as the over-the-top yet serious Clubber Lang. Rocky's use of his former rival, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), as his post-Mickey trainer is interesting, though of course the chemistry just isn't the same. And once again, the training sequences are inspiring.",6,English,3
145,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw3193346/?ref_=tt_urv,2015-02-28,An OK sequel to the first two but lost a lot of its umfph,"For the character of Rocky Balboa, success always seemed miles away. Struggling to make it through on a daily basis on the urban streets was never an easy task. His sluggish yet innocent personality made him an obvious target to individuals who wanted to take advantage of him. For all that, everything would change when he went toe-to-toe (twice) with the latest heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed. Even after the first fight, Rocky had become nothing short of legend. As for the rematch, it was what solidified his image as the rising star that he was. Rocky (1976) and Rocky II (1979) are the two films that book-ended this story so nicely. Of course there would be a continuation that would be in the form of this feature but did it maintain the same level of quality? It's there, but not as much. It's still a well-made and captivating entry but it lacks the substance that made the first two so gratifying to see.

The film begins like it did with its first sequel by recapping the finale of its predecessor and showing how much of a beating Rocky could really take. After winning the title, Rocky then becomes engrossed in his fame by covering promo ads, photo shoots, celebrity show cameos and interviews. Despite this, Rocky ends up confronting a new opponent named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and discovers he may not be as prepared as he thought, so Apollo Creed returns to get Rocky in shape one last time. As for Stallone's direction on how he wanted Rocky to develop as a character, the idea was absolutely fine. When someone becomes famous and is offered riches beyond their imagination, who wouldn't indulge? The lesson behind it all is that you can't let your guard down, no matter how comfortable you feel. Nonetheless, Stallone's writing misfires a number of times in compensation for his directing.

The problems in the screenplay are that unlike its forerunners, there are a couple of scenes that do not add any meaning to the story at hand. Right at the start, Rocky has to confront his Brother-in-law Pauly (Burt Young) about his reckless behavior. Turns out that Pauly is jealous over Rocky's fame, yet the matter is resolved all within the same scene. Another is the charity match between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). There's nothing wrong with this match up; who wouldn't want to see it? But the fact that it did not move the plot a long in any way other than for the spectacle of Hogan Vs Stallone had no use. These kinds of instances are wasteful. Meanwhile, the audience could have had more sentimental scenes between Rocky and his family. That's not the case though. The audience barely views any family time between Rocky, his wife Adrian and young son.

Instead, fans see Pauly constantly complaining and Adrian saying almost nothing important until close to the final act. Along with developing Rocky and his family, his opponent Clubber Lang receives little treatment either. It's hard to say if Clubber Lang's personality is actually Mr. T being himself or not. It's also another thing when a character is determined by something, but Lang doesn't seem to have a reason. Lang has hatred so strong that there's got to be more of a motive than just Rocky ignoring his demands for a match. No one holds that much resentment for a reason like that. Lang really just appears to be fuming out of nowhere for very little reason. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Tony Burton as Creed's coach were really the only true redeeming character additions. Meredith is able to provide a touching scene with Rocky and seeing Creed and his former coach team up with Rocky is also a plus. This particular element helps humanize Creed and his followers and makes them even more likable as characters.

The other remaining components that do work like before were the music and match fights. The way the fights are choreographed still have life in them and keep the sequences moving at a brisk pace as if to emulate how fast the fists are flying. Credit also goes to Bill Butler, who also was director of photography for Rocky II (1979) and Jaws (1975). Also, because this film represents how far Rocky drifted from his original life (living style), numerous shots contain everything from floor to ceiling of glam and riches galore. It's definitely flashy and displays how much wealth Rocky acquired but it's all style over substance (as explained before). The music composed again by Bill Conti did another efficient job. This time when it came to contemporary music of the time, ""Eye of the Tiger"" is emphasized more than anything else. ""Gonna Fly Now"" is still in there but ""Eye of the Tiger"" was given more priority. The Rocky theme is still played throughout as well along with the softer moments that occur. It's still a decent movie but wasn't executed entirely right.

Sylvester Stallone had the right idea on how to continue Rocky's story but his screenplay misses the point by including scenes that go nowhere instead of developing all of its characters like the first two films. Mr. T as Clubber Lang was certainly the right choice for an antagonist but he too barely has much depth. The music and fight sequences all still please to a point with Carl Weathers returning but without all of its developed characters, the heart of the story doesn't feel as strong.",6,English,3
146,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw1410831/?ref_=tt_urv,2006-07-04,Rocky 3 is to films as the Village People are to music,"When I saw this as a wide eyed 10 year old child I remember rockin' out of the cinema pumped up and ready take on people out in the street as if I were 29. But watching Rocky 3 again now I'm amazed I missed its subtle subtext of homosexuality amongst American boxers. When Apollo Creed approaches Rocky in the romantically dimmed gym in the middle of the night and calls him ""babe"", I suddenly saw the film in a new light. Then when Rocky says ""you got me curious"" and they lovingly stare at each other quietly, I realized the writers were taking the boxing legend into a new ring. The scene of Rocky and Apollo jumping up and down in the ocean in slow motion together in high cut pants was also something I missed as a kid. Then the punchy hook, as Mr T arrives, a surefire symbol of Rocky's denied homosexuality. His playful banter with Rocky's wife, ""I'll show you a real man"". When Rocky finally summons the courage to face him after spilling his guts to his wife, Mr T says ""I'm gonna touch you up"" and Rocky says ""Go for It!"" I had no idea.",6,English,3
147,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw1930887/?ref_=tt_urv,2008-08-16,Rocky V.S. Mr. T.,"This is probably the most popular Rocky movie because it has the versus word.

The plot is basically the same as in part II but with new characters and a plot twist on the principal fight.

Mr. T. was an interesting choice for Rocky's nemesis on the ring but I feel his presence was cheesy. Mr. T. was a marketing choice that served for it's purpose. Heck, he was very over the top on his scenes.

The dialogs are cheesy overall but it's a Rocky movie! You can expect our hero to recover from the worst situations and winning in the end.

Recommended only for Rocky fans.",6,English,1
148,Rocky 3,http:/review/rw0196272/?ref_=tt_urv,2000-11-18,A fresh life for the Rocky series. Stallone once again proves to be the master of making a sequel.,"Stallone goes the rounds as both writer and director in this the third installment of the Rocky series, and a winner is produced. Rocky III is often described as Sylvester Stallone vs. Mr. T. Much more can be found and learned from Rocky III the film for one contains emotion, love, sadness, dedication, and friendship but most of all the once again discovery of ""The Eye Of The Tiger"". You have it Rocky (Stallone) the heavyweight champion of the world makes ten straight title defenses with no problem, but complacency plagues Rocky who shows his odd manner by taking a circus act charity wrestling match against Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). The lack of training hurts Rocky and he suffers a crushing KO at the hands of punishing challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T) nearly at the same moment Mickey (Burgess Meredith) suffers a KO to his life in a physical sense only later to die with Rocky crying over him in the dressing room. Death actually occurs in two separate means with the death of Mick it's in a literal sense really happening and with the knockout title loss that Rocky (Stallone) suffered in a sense a figurative death occurred though not in an exact sense, but a title loss felt like death to Rocky (Stallone). I could see the graphic match technique was used to compare the loss and death scene, that's exactly what graphic match does it ties the story together with issues representing both a literal and figurative meaning. After the defeat Stallone once again meets up with former opponent and friend and think god Rocky has a friend Appollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who trains to help him once again discover ""The Eye Of The Tiger"". Wife Adrian (Talia Shire) supports Rocky to bury the past and to not once again become complacent, and to not bear the burden of Mick's death because guilt will only destroy, by once again believing in yourself and soul searching ""The Eye Of The Tiger"" can be found. In the rematch with Lang which went three rounds with a KO going to Rocky ""The Eye Of The Tiger"" was discovered. See a fresh start and be like millions of others and discover ""The Eye Of The Tiger"".",6,English,3

This fun but less compelling entry has its moments of enjoyment, but you can't stop thinking why he is even bothering with this loser in the first place. Has a great 80's song to help it along but unfortunately you're just not excited by the finale. The first two succeeded in their own little way, but this one falls a bit flat. 3/5",6,English,3
